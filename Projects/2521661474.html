Hebrew English </p><p>(Definitions of Humility -&gt; earth - REALITY</p><p>CATHOLIC:<br/>In the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14&amp;version=NABRE" rel="nofollow">fourteenth chapter of the <em>Gospel According to Luke</em> (NABRE)</a><em>,</em> Jesus calls us to <strong>humility</strong>. Critical to growth in the spiritual life, humility also is an easily misunderstood concept. In this parable, Jesus explains humility as a function of status.</p><p>The <strong>Greek </strong>word translated as humility, ταπεινόω (<em>tapeinoo</em>)<em>,</em> literally refers to height and suggests making oneself low or close to the ground. The<strong> Latin </strong>root of the word humble, <em>humus</em>, means the ground or the earth. <strong>Even today, </strong>we talk about status and class in terms of height with people being seen as higher and upper, or lower. In this context, humility is making ourselves lower, not in the physical but in the social sense. Note that status is not the same as identity. Humility does not call us to be less than we are. It is only in play in terms of our relative position and more importantly our perception of ourselves when compared to others.</p><p /><p>Messianic Jewish <br/>actually a useful article about how<strong> BEIng the Spiritual gifts is what helps others!!</strong><br/>Psalms 34:2: “My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear [thereof], and be glad.”  <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://www.chaimbentorah.com/2016/02/word-study-the-humble-%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%94/" rel="nofollow">https://www.chaimbentorah.com/2016/02/word-study-the-humble-%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%94/</a> <br/>”When I boast I do not make the humble glad but I make them cringe.  Yet, if our soul our hearts are praising God the humble will be glad.  The word <em>glad</em> in Hebrew is <em>samach</em> which comes from a Semitic root to describe the <em>morning sunrise</em> this is when everything that was in the dark begins to <em>brighten up.</em> You can really be down in the dumps and feeling dark and gloomy like Eeyore but when you are around someone who is just rejoicing in the Lord, I mean it is coming from the heart and not the mind,  you cannot help but <em>samach, brighten up</em>. But that <em>boasting</em> must come from the soul or heart, not the mind. Nothing, at least for me, is more irritating than someone pretending to be joyful in the Lord. “</p><p>anyway <br/>”<br/>  There are a few words in Hebrew that are rendered as <em>humble</em>. <strong> This word is for </strong><em><strong>humble ‘anav</strong></em><strong> from the root word </strong><em><strong>anah</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Although the English word <em>humble</em> is not an incorrect translation, in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century English it could be very misleading.  <em>Anah</em> carries <strong>old English definition of </strong><em><strong>humble</strong></em><strong> and that is one who has really been through the ringer.</strong> I mean he has lost his job, his money, his house and his cat has died. Such a person in old English would say he was <em>humbled</em>. Today we use the word humble to mean a <u>lack of pride.</u> …<strong> Lack of pride is just a byproduct of </strong><em><strong>anah</strong></em><strong>.</strong>  <em>Anah </em>is really a word that is used for someone who is <em><strong>depressed and/or afflicted</strong></em><strong>.</strong> In the<strong> Aramaic</strong> it is used for someone who is <em><strong>oppressed.</strong></em><strong> </strong><br/>”<br/>( I say HUMILITY PRACTICE)</p><p>.<br/>Strong's Hebrew - Search results for: humble - <em>83 entries found.
