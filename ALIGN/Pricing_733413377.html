You can pay less, or more, than that price, and we will receive it with real gratitude.</p><p>Also, this is our <strong>Professional Rate</strong> - if you are leveraging these offerings in your work, now, i.e. you are a business leader and you are self-paying or you are a budding entrepreneur and your micro-business is paying or you work for a non-profit/ Religious Organization and they are paying - please invest at least this much.</p><p><br/></p><p>3.</p><p><strong>The left column</strong>.: We decided, from the Soul, to set a <strong>minimum sustainable contribution</strong>. It is 'pay from the Soul', and it has to agree with our Soul as well as your own.</p><p>It’s important to us that we are honest with you, and not pretending 'Align on Purpose' doesn’t have needs, because we do. </p><p>With employees, and all the costs associated with running a business, we do have a certain amount that has to come in for it to be possible for us to keep serving.</p><p>Our Souls just don't feel good lower than this, it is operating at a loss.
