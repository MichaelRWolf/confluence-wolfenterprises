They are masters of the earth-game (all the challenges and lessons we are tripping over) and they embody the balance of spiritual life in a physical body. They can assist us to walk our path with more seniority, spiritual perspective, and power. They offer compassion, neutrality and amusement in the places where we are still judging and resisting ourselves, others and the world.</p><p>What is exciting about this opportunity, is that we energetically Work Together WITH an Ascended Master.  So, you don't just intellectually learn about Ascended Masters - because, as interesting as that may be, it won't change your life!!!  We actually learn from the Master Consciously, and more importantly Energetically.  Energetically learning from a Master has no intellectual meaning, it is an energetic reality which must be experienced...</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Draft of my outline for the class:</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I'm a Psychic Energy Healer!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Aura healing</p><p>Check-in</p><p><br/></p><p>We will work with Ascended Master Lemar </p><ul><li><p>He will play with us in Healing, Growth, Learning as Change. </p></li><li><p>Learn with him to change/heal ourselves and our world. </p></li><li><p>Open to a new way of running our creative/healing energies.</p></li><li><p>Healing IS Change</p><p>Healing iS Creation</p></li></ul><p>We will play with many concepts and practices, including:</p><ul><li><p>Concepts that assist us to be safe &amp;

I've spent an inordinate amount of time with her since her first visit to PA, being sympathetic, present and responsive to her questions, providing healings and validating her experience to great detail. </p><p><strong>Her request about looking at beings in her partner was not made to me directly, it was made during the last <u>reading clinic</u>.</strong> She started talking about her partner and beings and a wheel-spinning started that quickly worked into a state that was intense. Our reading line was mostly people <u>who had never been to PA before</u> and yes, they were noticeably uncomfortable. Joe was in center chair and he actually asked me to take over.</p><p>I was firm, but certainly not harsh or dismissive. I care about her well-being and am super sensitive that she is sensitive about her situation. That said, she is used to my being soft and gentler with her and this required being a little more direct. I balanced validation about her experience with bringing her back to her own power and abilities to keep herself grounded and clear. I was mindful to be compassionate, yet clear that: <strong>A.</strong>  The clinic is about reading each other, and so we were not going to read her partner <strong>B</strong>. I understand she is having a hard time, but she has the proven power, ability, courage and discipline to be grounded and clear so let's turn the focus away from Joseph and be here in the moment so she can get some good information from the other readers. </p><p><strong>The outcome is that she calmed down, we got back on track and she got an awesome reading. </strong>I checked in with her at the end of the clinic to make sure she was OK, and gave her a warm hug. I thought things were ok.<br/>Anyway, would love to talk about this more on Monday.</p><p>Thanks for hearing me out : ).Susan<br/>-------- Original Message --------<br/>Subject: Re: PT 102 shift<br/>From: Wendy Wolf &lt;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:WendyRunningWolf@att.net" rel="nofollow">WendyRunningWolf@att.net</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Sat, January 26, 2013 1:13 pm<br/>To: Aera Crescent &lt;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:xxaeracrescentxx@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">xxaeracrescentxx@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p><p>Hey Aera  - my plate is kinds full, so I just got a chance to read your letter.thanks for sharing, and for being in the game!<br/>re: your partner: Almost every one has beings, the being aren't important, it is you being in charge of your ship, and plugging the holes, so they don't get in… that is primary, from my perspective; and from most PA readers, you will hear similar feedback. <br/>Some folks in class and at PA are bothered by your energy and your beings, more than others, that is more about them than it is about you. And it is something to manage, for us - to help all feel safe.<br/>Using your techniques both while sitting in meditation and in your everyday life is highly recommended - all the time, as much as you can. Yes, you can do this, so yay, do it!<br/>You seemed to appreciate working with Scott, he has been an invaluable resource for me in the last decade, to assist me to own my space more. If you are interested, I can see if he is willing to work with your for a reduced rate or something...</p><p>I'm a bit busy, but wanted to get back to you <a class="external-link" href="http://asap.In" rel="nofollow">asap.In</a> the next couple days, I will get you the audio from the last 102 class so you can listen to it, and II will send you the next one as well.  I will find some times to meet and get back to you about it.<br/>No use second thinking yourself, this is your path and your incredible challenges will be met with incredible rewards, as you meet them. You are a Force to be reckoned with, just keep going.<br/>hugs, Wendy</p><p>On Jan 25, 2013, at 1:51 PM, Aera Crescent wrote:<br/>Wendy -  I am not exactly sure why I sent the message I did. I think I was out of control and somebody decided they wanted to get an edge in and wanted to try to lock me out completely. I was in a lot of dispair and was in a long dissasociative walk, where I had quickly left my partner's house after an argument - walked incredibly fast, and ended up trailing over a couple of miles after midnight. <br/>While of course being yammered to in my head almost the entire time. <br/>When I got home, something sat on my hand after I 'came to' and became clear again. It was very warm and a ray of warmth seemed to protrude from the back of my hand, rather than from my palm - and my partner noticed it was 'slightly warmer' than the rest of the room. To me it was incredibly hot. And there was like something, like an invisible butterfly or ant sitting on my finger. And the being moved to stand on the floor infront of me, and Reuter also felt it to be 'slightly warmer' than the rest of the room. Again, to me it felt incredibly hot. </p><p>I walked so far, and found my way back to his place, and don't quite remember all the stuff I saw or passed. This has got to stop, but I'm noticing I'm defiant to do what the voices inside my head tell me to do - which is to meditate. I don't want to give them the satisfaction of me doing anything they tell me to do. Instead I snap back at them and tell them to get the fuck out and to go away, that i never want to see or hear them again. </p><p>I astral projected again today, 'swum' up out of my body, spun around, and was told to ground to the universe and to the ground, which I did, and then I was able to start moving around in this area I went to. No one was there. It was completely empty!!! The trip was brief and then I woke up and felt my body kind of 'catch up'. </p><p>I have a lot of problems around my partner, falling down, I'll be talking to him and then I'll realize, it's not me talking to him, or I have doubt that its me, and then I'll feel really floaty. It's why I asked during one of my readings if there were Beings in his space, or if there were problems there, and Susan didn't quite answer that. She doesn't seem to really answer those questions. Instead she's just very firm on what she believes to be the solution. And it's scary for me. So I kind of feel like some of the teachers in training bring their own personal background/feelings in and are not unbiased in a way. It's hard to explain what i&quot;m trying to convey here. I have a difficult time understanding or communicating with a lot of individuals, especially since I never thought of myself as in this psychic community or 'woo woo' (which I hat that term)</p><p>I know Maria and I have a lot of things in common, energetically and I wouldn't be surprised if we do from our life experiencies. When I gave back some of her energy, there was a lot there. When I received mine back from the room, it was intense. I was conscious enough to try to put seperation roses between us, and we ended up on the bus next to each other and I tried really hard to keep my Aura in really close to my body. Something about her keeps me on edge a little and I'm very sensitive to how I might impose on her, unintentionally.<br/>I bother her, and I know it. And I take precautions now that i have the tools, so I don't bother her. So it was very emberassing to be knocked out of body and have that spell, and have her walk in on that. I respect her, and whenever she tries to reach out to me and tell me bits of information from her background, it means a lot. Because I do feel I annoy the crap out of her, that I overwhelm her. <br/>Something tells me, internally - and i've been hearing this in my clairaudience, that I've done this in many lifetimes. And it came up in my first aura reading (and the student remarked that I needed to 'take a break sister! And obviously I can't, Wendy) that I've done psychic work before. When I worked with Scott, he said that moving my energy around is not new to me. I'm no beginner at this. <br/>I can put grounding coords down and move my energy about without sitting in a chair, I can be walking and consciously pull in my aura and put up protection roses and move earth and cosmic energy. It's probably not as effective as sitting with my eyes closed, but I can do it. And with sheer will of force, I feel that i can move things out of my space. <br/>One of my beings didn't like it when I tried to channel red energy, I think it was red, and grab him with my hands and move him out. I got cussed at a lot for that. <br/>I spontaneously seem to run energy up my leg channels, different colors, and I see this in my clairvoyance now. This is running all too fast. I remember when my third eye started pulsating early last summer. And I remember when I decided to do automatic drawing, and I didn't even do it for that long, and now i'm like this. </p><p>I was stupid enough to not research how to turn it off before I began. I thought I would be okay. If I had not of tried to contact my spirit guides by automatic drawing, I wouldn't be in this mess, Maria wouldn't be bothered by me, and you and I wouldn't be having this conversation. And perhaps, just perhaps, I wouldn't have gone to Alaya Gold, gotten the spirit guide channeling done at the Greenwood Library with her pendulum (which she said a protection spell/prayer) and I wouldn't have gotten Joseph's name. and Emily's name wouldn't have come to me in a dream. Maybe i'd be okay still right now. </p><p>But that's illogical, because I was starting to have clairaudience before I started automatic drawing. I wouldn't be okay, if anything, I wouldn't be trancing. I would probably just be 'hearing voices' and on a strong anti psychotic. <br/>So - I'd like to talk about finishing up 102, I think that it will go faster in private training. There are tools I simply just do not use because they do not seem to benifit me. However, I think it would be more beneficial if I had a printout of all the tools, or a reminder of each one.  <br/>I do not live far from where your location in Ballard is. We could meet there to do it, if there is an opening in your schedule. I am busy Monday. <br/>I would be interested in going onto Healing Hands, if that is something you feel would be good for me. I was feeling pulled towards Reiki for a while, but I know someone who teaches Reiki and I can learn that at a later date. </p><p>I have been considering my long-term goals with PA, and while I understand you can do trade work to take off some of the cost of the CAP program, I'm unsure if that would be right for me right now. I think getting through each thing one at a time would be best, and healing hands, so that I could begin to take care of myself and learn what actual positively aligned beings feel like. I think that  it's worth discussing further. </p><p>On Thu, Jan 24, 2013 at 9:17 AM, Wendy Wolf &lt;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:WendyRWolf@att.net" rel="nofollow">WendyRWolf@att.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>Dear Stephanie <br/>I am sad to hear about your partner!And disappointed to hear about non-support in other places.Not everyone has the tools And the willingness to deal with TM energy.As you know, the energy can be a real pain ; )<br/>I would feel sad and rejected if I were asked to not come to class for awhile, as I asked you.I wasn't happy to ask you to go to private training, AND I believe you are aware of why I needed to do that: to give my other students a break from the intensity.<br/>I see that you have come SO far in the ownership of your space and energy.I see that you can continue to improve the quality of your inner world, as well as your outer interactions with others.I know you can continue to enjoy more seniority... as you choose to do so.<br/>All of the staff and teachers-in-training at Psychic Awakenings are well-equipped to assist you in your journey.I believe you have experienced this.<br/>All of our students, especially new folks, are not energetically equipped to handle TM energy or socially flexible enough to handle your behavior comfortably.I believe you have experienced this.<br/>As we discussed, in groups of new folks,it is helpful to the group if you focus on managing your energy, and be consciously sharing less about your high-energy experiences and information (its 'kindergarden' ; )<br/>All of the staff and teachers-in-training at Psychic Awakenings want to assist you in your journey.We believe we offer tremendous levers to you in your spiritual journey, in your spiritual warfare.I am happy to work privately with you to complete PT 102, and coordinate other appropriate group and/or private support for your journey.<br/>Its your choice to play with us or not, as you choose.Sending angels, it looks very intense for you right now!Please take good care.<br/>hugs, Wendy</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p>On Jan 24, 2013, at 1:37 AM, Aera Crescent wrote:<br/>I don't feel very good about this anymore.

I KNOW that place.  Wendy and I used to laugh about it, about getting to the gravy - when were we going to get there?  And we did.  It's just that changing ourselves from the inside is a sea change, and sea changes take time.  <br/>I hope this is helpful.  I know that you're in an especially difficult situation, probably way more severe than what I had to face.  At least I could function with a modicum of normalcy in the world.  <br/>You are this strange creature, I guess similar to a lot of us playing this spiritual game:  on one hand you are aware at your core that you are simply a breath-takingly amazing person.  On the other hand, all too often you feel totally invalidated in the world, wretched and totally at odds with what's around you.  I get it. It helps me to write this because though I'm a lot further along than I was I'm still working against my own habits to take my place in the world of successful people.  I'm still working to be in that place where I live each moment shining my own amazing light.  To be in the place where I OWN how amazing I am.  <br/>I believe when enough of us wake up to that the world will change for the better, which is a good thing because it seems to be heading in a pretty scary direction right at the moment.  The tools we've learned are the most direct path I've found to reach that 2nd place.  I believe they're life-saving, and it's the joy of my life to be able to help other &quot;strange creatures&quot; like yourself to begin to really live from the place where they are as amazing as they've, inwardly, always known they were.<br/>Anyway, Stephanie, I hope this helps. I wish you could see how privileged I feel to be working with you.  <br/>Anyway, take care and I'll see you Thursday.<br/>-Scott</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p>On Tue, Mar 19, 2013 at 4:06 PM, Aera Crescent &lt;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:xxaeracrescentxx@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">xxaeracrescentxx@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>Hello.</p><p>I think I deserve a couple of answers, since I&quot;ve been diligent and have been moving forward bravely here.</p><p>Maybe i'm 'sticking too close to my analyzer', but I&quot;ve been noticing a cycle, and I want some answers about this, and I would like both Scott and Wendy's opinion on this, before I commit myself to another month with Scott. It also has to do with every time I work with Kimba and other things I feel around other people who come to healing clinics. </p><p>Something I want to address first - my dreams. My dreams are, and have been - getting rather vivid. And at one point I hugged someone in my dream and then came back through light, I was seeing golden light, and then I felt my body squeeze like I was being hugged back. And now I'm experiencing a lot of clairsentience in that moment when I return to my body. Last night, I heard a lot of music, and then felt someone crawling/stepping around on my bed, and I was dreaming i was laying in it, and my body was moving around and I was screaming for them to stop, and that I was getting up. I woke up in my bed, and things were calm. </p><p>In the dream, I was terrified. When I woke up, I didn't feel anything. </p><p>This leads me to the second issue - when I work with Kimba, we break all these agreements, and last night, I experienced some major healing and some major clairsentience during my healing and even Rapheal came through, however, I started having a lot of adverse reactions/issues when a professional psychic was in the room, and he was talking about channeling and stuff, and I just had to get out of the room, and Joe had finished up a healing. I asked for his help because I couldn't seem to ground, and HE mentioned Joeseph. Then Kimba came back into the kitchen and started on with me again about beings and stuff and then I sat down and began to break some agreements, and I seemed to have broken this chain link of agreements spanning multiple lifefetimes.</p><p>However, it was unclear and no one could give me a clear answer as to whether or not you could MAKE THEM GO AWAY PERMANATELY. WHICH IS WHAT I NOW WANT TO DO. And Kimba simply said that one day I would become senior to them. <br/>it now of my opinion that I wish to DESTROY them. However, energy can neither be created nor destroyed  and I am very upset about this. How can GOD create beings that would BOTHER and TORTURE someone like me constantly? or even ALLOW these arrangements to be made? I break agreements, even here at home. I scream, I cry, and somehow, I end up hurting myself, cutting myself, and I get told to kill myself, overdose, return to god, etc etc.<br/>Then at some point i concede, give up the fight, because it's too hard to be in the center of my head, it's too hard to be in my body with all the pain and the anguish when certain beings come around. </p><p>Why can't they just be PERMANATELY removed? I am very sad that i Have to live this way, very angry. And I am sorry, but I'm thinking of ending my life. I don't like my dreams, I don't like having beings in my dreams, and certainly when I break an agreement, it is immeidatley replaces, and I can't ask my parents for help, becuse she's still married to my stepfather who molested me, and there's some agreement or really bad energy behind that, that obviously no one can help me heal.</p><p>It's just really bad. </p><p>So I guess I dont' really have a question, more so than I have to say that this is just all one really bad cycle. I break agreements, beings go away temporarily, they come back. I have to scramble around, I panic  I struggle to stay in the center of my head, I use my tools, then somehow I end up beating myself, punching myself in my groin, cutting my arms, choking myself, sometimes I stop breathing, and I have to struggle to breathe, my neck spasms, I have all sorts of bad stuff popping up...</p><p>And I get all sorts of resistance to people and places and I can't seem to move forward. It's like I HAVE to stay by myself and not go anywhere or do anything to keep the beings from bothering me. It's like I have to avoid my partner sometimes to keep from being bothered, and now I have to find another place to live because I'm really bothered by how my roommate has a lot of sex with many different people and it brings up bad energy for me. Yet i cannot afford it. </p><p>Returning to a pure energy state and seeing if I'm going to get tortured and hurt by the beings out of body might be a better option at this point. IT's like I have this critical energy disability and I'm looking at this now from the standpoint of: &quot;Well, is it time to just say goodbye?&quot; </p><p>What do you think? I'm really tired of being abused. My parents have some money, but I can't go near them because I have too many problems and too many bad memories. I like that Kimba likes to work with me, but when I feel confident that I'm safe and secure and that I've broken all these bookshelves of agreements, only to be bothered, moved, and  hearing the beings again later that night.. it makes me wonder - am I just fooling myself? </p><p>Is it just a cycle? Did that chain of roses I snipped from my rose just connect back immediately? It seems a lot of stuff just does that to me. I get rid of it, and then it comes back. I'm so tired of it. I don't want to live like this anymore. I want to be away from all the noise. </p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>LLL</p><p><br/></p><p>I LOVE this e-mailthank you Madeline ; )</p><p>On Mar 28, 2013, at 5:46 PM, Madeline Hartman wrote:<br/></p><blockquote><p>(Tamela &amp; Wendy, I left the recorder with the yesterday's STP class on the desk for Amber to send to you).</p><p> </p><p>Yesterday both Joanna and Eric gave their prepared lectures.  This homework arosed out of the feed back for their presentations.</p><p> </p><p>1) WHAT IS ENERGY??

Would it be appropriate for Psychic Awakenings (actually my colleague Wendy Wolf) to rent a reading booth and then bring two or three of our students to read with her?  What it would like like is that  Wendy would do each reading, but the students would sit along side her during each reading and make a few verbal contributions. This is how I train my students.  Reading at a fair would be a wonderful experience for them.  The students will have just started the program (May 7), and will not be ready to read on their own yet. If more than three of our students are interested, then we would rent two reading booths.  I would be in the second booth doing readings and have some of the students sit along side me.Please let me know if you think this would work at your Psychic Fair.Take care,Madeline</p><p><strong>From:</strong> Rev.

I see jealousy &amp; idealization as the two sides of the double edged sword called competition. I recognize that I'm experiencing competition when I'm hyper focusing on someone, thinking I could have done it better, or I would have done it different or they do it soooo well... I suck. Or I'm just uncomfortable around them... Like their sooo cool .... I'm speechless. Or I just can't stand them...</p><p>they literally make my stomach churn &amp; I'm repelled by their presence.</p><p>All these are universal feelings all of us</p><p>experience from time to time. It called competition. It's not bad or good it just is.  It can be harmful to ourselves &amp; others if we let it rule us. If we are conscious of our competition we can learn to liberate ourselves from its harmful effects. Being conscious of our competition allows us to validate ourselves, own our creations, rise above our limitations, &amp; allows us to peacefully connect to others &amp; validate them as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>So here's a few spiritual tools I find helpful in navigating &amp; liberating myself from these uncomfortable encounters:</p><p><br/></p><p>#1 Remember the answer is not to completely avoid contact with these individuals.

Maybe deep down your jealous of the fact that they can talk effortlessly without concern for others &amp; your so hyper focused on what other people think of you that you have a hard time ever opening your mouth. </p><p>In this case competition can soar! Validate yourself that you have your own unique voice &amp; have something important to say. Notice that the person talking the most may be the person who is in need of validation the most. </p><p>And they may be talking incessantly to</p><p>get validation. Maybe you never felt heard as a child &amp; this person reminds you of your family who never heard you. So this person may be a teacher to you if you can put your competition aside to Speak out your Truth! &amp; Voice your Words as an adult in a way in which you Get to be heard.

I hate having to act like a mother and nag to get things done. OWNING IT means that  in addition to fulfilling your own responsibilities, if you see something that needs to be done, please do it, get a student to do it, or bring it up at a staff meeting.  If for some reason you are unable to fulfill a responsiblity on a particular day or during a particular week, just communicate so no one is caught off-guard. I can deal with the occassional lapse due to growth periods, but be aware that now there are several of you and I can deal with only so many  lapses on the same day.</p><p> </p><p>I've been busting my butt for over seven years to create this space and I know you all value it.  Now I need (and greatly appreciate) your help to keep it growing and thriving.  As it grows bigger and thrives, it attracts even more people (and thus requiring more energy and support).  With everyone's help and proper attitude, it can be NO EFFORT and very validating for all of us.  </p><p> </p><p>I am really, really, really excited and looking forward to what we all will be creating together. And depending the bond and communication between us all.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p><p> </p><p>Madeline</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p><br/></p><p>Money, payment, students in space, students hitting their shit and attacking </p><p><br/></p><p>Hey Madelinethanks for tracking this!<br/>if this is new info for Tamela, it could be 'sensitive' - are you will to call her and make sure she is ok?it may feel uncomfortable and abrupt with just an e-mail<br/>i will support her too, as neededthanks; 0 W</p><p /><p>On Aug 2, 2013, at 2:11 PM, Madeline Hartman wrote:<br/></p><blockquote><p>Hi Wendy,</p><p>Thought you would want to be copied on this email to Tamela.  At the graduation,  her official certificate will be pending.  I bought red folders for the certificates so that no one will be able to see the &quot;false&quot; certificates that say &quot;Certificate Pending completion of obligations.&quot;  Same as for Kieara.</p><p> </p><p>Madeline</p><p><br/><strong>From:</strong> Madeline Hartman [<a class="external-link" href="mailto:madeline@psychicawakeningsseattle.com" rel="nofollow">mailto:madeline@psychicawakeningsseattle.com</a>] <br/><strong>Sent:</strong> Friday, August 02, 2013 2:07 PM<br/><strong>To:</strong> 'Tamela Graling'<br/><strong>Subject:</strong> Just a reminder...</p><p>Hi Tamela, You still have a few months of STP tuition payments to make:  <strong>STP</strong>Dec '12Jan. 2013Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJuneJulyAugSepOctTotals Tamela Graling$200.00   $200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$200.00$250.00$2,250.00               The red figures are what you still owe:August: $200Sept:    $200Oct:      $250.Total: $650.00 You will still graduate tomorrow (hurray!).
