'On Work ' - <a class="external-link" href="http://www.katsandogz.com/onwork.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.katsandogz.com/onwork.html</a> <br/>- “The privilege to work is a gift. The power to work is a blessing. The love of work is success.” - David O. McKay<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How can this system help YOU?</strong><br/><br/></p><p>to help you step into your next challenge</p><p>to help you see faster and deeper results</p><p>to provide more ways to connect with me and with the Soul School and with others who are dancing a similar path<br/><br/><br/></p><p>get over yourself, your past, what and who has stopped you, turned you aside <br/>not by ignoring all this - but by utlizing it as grist for the mill<br/>where we trip is out treasure</p><p><br/><strong>HOW does this system work?</strong><br/><br/>Archimedes<br/>Fulcrum Lever Stand - move world<br/><br/>Become Captain of Life <br/>then Add your Vision/Calling <br/><br/></p><p>Hone your Vision</p><p>build focus, attention and intention</p><p>all of this is lacking these days<br/><br/><br/>We collaborate - sometimes I lead and sometimes you lead - creating a Dance of Learning, Healing and Possibility<br/>My job is for you to become an ever-more solid soul reader, healer, teacher, leader - or as much of this as you desire, as we invest together<br/><br/><br/></p><p>ZZZ</p><p>working with me starts where working with some others ends <br/>telling your story<br/>even seeing your habits, patterns, recapitulation<br/><br/>this helps, but not enough<br/><br/>just do it, turn on a dime <br/>a few can do it - most of us can't<br/><br/>many can rearrange deck-chairs<br/>but who amoung us can turn the titanic?<br/><br/>we can! <br/>but it takes something!<br/><br/>* by going together into your soul:</p><p>below <strong>emotions &amp; drives</strong>,</p><p>below <strong>thoughts &amp; beliefs</strong>,</p><p>below <strong>what you did &amp; what was done to you</strong>...<br/><br/>* by continually learning and practicing together:<br/><strong>operating from our soul</strong>, not our personality, or what others expect<br/><strong>shifting from the inside out</strong>, with ease and grace, not effort and striving <br/><strong>opening to our soul senses &amp; abilities</strong>, comfortably and powerfully utilizing <br/><strong>making the unconscious conscious</strong>, in ourselves and in our creations<br/><br/>* by shifting who we believe we are, as we dig deeper together: <br/>(through the ego, through the crap, through the stories, limits &amp; lies, through the pain, fear &amp; shame, through the games, through the addictions and distractions, through the victim patterns, through the shadow, though the momentum of our lives...) <br/>into who we Really Are<br/><br/></p><p>this is a process<br/>but how can we even do all this?<br/><br/>Strangely Archimedes helps us with a metaphor <br/><br/>Give me but a firm spot on which to stand, <br/>and a lever long enough, <br/>and I will move the world.<br/><br/>with <br/>fulcrum - identity - who do you think you are? we already spoke of this<br/>shifting this is a process<br/><br/>powerful tools, levers in our own soul - accessed through metaphor, helping us access below the level of our consciousness<br/>these are a minute to learn and a lifetime to master<br/>there are a lot of them, so it takes a bit of time t learn them all, and creatively apply them<br/><br/>powerful places to stand - certainty, neutrality, seniority, etc - these are vibrations, attitudes within ourself<br/>all of these help us stand on rock not sand - these soul blessings are available to all who ask and are willing to receive<br/><br/>to move you, move your mind, move your body, move your world</p><p><br/></p><p><br/>ZZZ</p><p>In this Practice, we start and end with Soul<br/>But also learn Body love and care, relationship, communication and co-creation<br/>as well as <br/>Mind support &amp; discipline, distinctions &amp; practices, insights &amp; new paradigms from cutting-edge thought leaders, and retraining &amp; reinforcement to serve our Soul's Goals</p><p>Body and Mind alone cannot get us where our soul wants to go,<br/>but they can certainly make it easier or harder!<br/><br/>As we learn to love, appreciate and work-together with our Mind and our Body<br/>- including our emotions, needs, and drives - <br/>Our Life, our Relationships, and our Leadership become more Graceful, Beautiful, Delightful...</p><p><br/></p><p><br/><br/><strong>WHY am I passionate about this, and what it means for YOU?</strong><br/><br/>Teleios is my passion since teenager <br/>and only moreso as i go <br/>for me, for all <br/>to contribute to the individual journey and the humans evolution <br/>of becoming who we ARE<br/><br/><br/>old, female, introvert, snesitive soul, inner-focused, crative/ artistic, lover not identified as a business person, queer -

what you want and what you can expect, talk over your needs and what is possible for you<br/>This is not the kind of coaching that has been all the craze, in the last few years <br/>- I will not be holding you 'accountable' on specific tasks, unless you ask me to <br/>- I will not be running you through a particular set-structure or preconceived exercises <br/><br/>I do have a large set of tools to share <br/>I do have ideas about some bases to cover on the way to making the homeruns that you want to make <br/>When I teach workshops, series, and especially in the Big Programs - I do have a set, step-by step structure that everyone learns and masters.<br/><br/>But, one of the values of Private Sessions <br/>You get what you need, when you need it.<br/><br/>Certainly at first, we will need some basic tools<br/>But within your first session, we will be taking off running into specifcs of<br/>what to learn<br/>where to heal<br/>what to develop <br/>where to allow shift <br/><br/>We will chat a bit - as much as you choose<br/>But, really this is not the point <br/><br/>We will go within <br/>as deep as you are ready and comfortable going<br/>and each time this is different <br/><br/>get the lay of the land<br/>be with what is <br/>and begin the process of shifting<br/><br/>from a place of safety, comfort, ease - within <br/>We start is to grow the freedom within your own soul<br/><br/>Everything we do will be within you<br/>at first, nothing will change in your life, in your world.<br/>not until your body and your life are ready.<br/><br/>ZZZ<br/><br/></p><p>Leadership Promises <br/><br/>Every Session<br/>We will uncover and become conscious about what works and doesn't work in your soul and in your world<br/>we will learn ever more tools, techniques, distinctions and be empowered to shift - letting go of what doesn't work and letting in new vibrations, blessings, places to stand<br/><br/>As you do the inner work in and between sessions<br/>- stuff will come up and out to clear - at first this will probably not feel so good, but<br/>- over time you will find more freedom within, become more conscious of your inner world, and what is going on in your outer world<br/>- you will become ready to shift your life - not with control, striving, manipulation - rather with ease, grace and beauty <br/><br/>As you keep going<br/>- you will become Captain of your life - what you say goes within you, and into your life <br/>- who you are BEing will shift - you will be attracting, instead of repelling people and opportunities, you will share love, joy peace with those in your field<br/>- you will become a Soul Leader  - wherever you go, you will be playing your own game toward your own goals -
