                    <p>from Seth Godin  *Some problems are easier to sell*</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://wolfenterprises.slack.com/archives/CFWP5PGNR/p1550325383002200" rel="nofollow">https://wolfenterprises.slack.com/archives/CFWP5PGNR/p1550325383002200</a><br/><br/><br/>We all have a Genuis Zone - stuff we are naturally good-at (and something we aren’t naturally inclined to, as well)</p><p>Directly related:<br/>Each of us has something in this world that only we can do - a difference only we can make - a Calling.</p><p>The question is - are we operating here?<br/>How much of our natural abilities are we enjoying? sharing with our world?<br/>Are we aligned with our Unique Way in this world.</p><p>When we aren’t it can be painful - in our soul and in our life.<br/>When we aren’t, life can feel to easy - not challenging enough - or too hard - too challenging and we can’t ever win.<br/>This is because we are playing the wrong game!</p><p>This can feel like boring (Jack &amp; Diane)<br/>It can seem like we are missing the boat - how come everyone else is succeeding, and I’m not?<br/>This can look like being off track - Dr Bruce used to say, when we are driving our car, and we get off the road, we start hitting things - mailboxes, trees, houses… When we are off-track in our lives, it can be similar.</p><p>Everyone is here with a Reason, a Purpose, something that fulfills us and serves in the symphony of our world.<br/>And if we will not play our role in the orchestra - everyone loses our contribution, and most of all WE miss our opportunity.<br/>This is not a one-time shot, the door never closes on this - until we step off the stage - but the sooner we consciously invest, the more fulfilling our life can be.</p><p>If you are fulfilled, making a difference, utilizing your Genius, satisfied with the Legacy that you are building, enjoying the fruit of your life - within you and in your world.<br/>Hallelujah! Bless you. Keep on.</p><p>For the rest of us, I would like to encourage that<br/>living a Life a Meaning, is worth our attention, our intention, our Choice.</p><p>Our society wants to focus on quick-fixes, success defined in very narrow ways, dying with lots of toys…<br/>But most of this seems to me to be a lot of empty calories.</p><p>What if we lived in a Dance with life that was Creative,<br/>that brought our the Best in those around us,<br/>that inspired us to live a challenge big enough to get us over all the resistance, the friction that keeps us from living our dreams.</p><p>We live with missing the mark in our lives, its often just background noise - until:<br/>- our birthday, especially one ending n a 0, reminds us of where we are and who we wanted to be…<br/>- a health crises, death of a loved-one, something intense happens in our world…<br/>- something shifts, possibilities open - we enter a wonderful relationship, a child is born in our tribe, our finances improve, our nest empties, we retire…</p><p>But every day that goes by, if we are just getting by, living a mundane life - it is a tragedy.<br/>And the symptoms increase as the days, years, decades go by.</p><p>but we often don’t notice,<br/>or if we do notice we call it depression and take some drugs, we call it mid-lie crisis and buy a fast car<br/>and eventually we die unfulfilled, not savoring, not manifesting, not lighting up the world - with the life we could have lived.</p><p>We have a choice about this - everyone of us - not just the rich and famous - not just those of us with moderate means and no one paying attention. Every adult has a choice, at every moment. We read stories about elderly,, wealthy, queer, of color… or not - doing amazing things, having incredible lives, making a huge difference. Why not us?</p><p>Saying yes to the Call, to a Life of Purpose, to the Way before us,<br/>is a challenge.<br/>It is called the Hero’s Journey for a reason:</p><p>It will cost us - in one way or another: time, money, energy.<br/>It will cost us our pride - we won’t always know the way, and some days the dragon will win.<br/>It will cost us our certainty and our righteousness - we will Learn and Shift, and so will how we perceive and relate-to our world and ourselves.</p><p>Regardless of the difficulty, the challenge to our sense of self and the many potential pitfalls,<br/>Living the Life of our Dreams, is worth it.</p><p>Anything else is shortsighted.<br/>The whole time I am typing this, I am hearing<br/>The Un-Examined Life is Not Worth Living <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
