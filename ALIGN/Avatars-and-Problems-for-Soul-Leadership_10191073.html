But she doesn't quite know what to do and how to get there<br/><br/>In her everyday life, she is tripping over molehills, when she wants to be climbing mountains in relationships and contribution<br/><br/>Feels broken and not chosen - She feels frustrated by feeling invalidated by and left-out by others, and there has been plenty of that in her experience, but the issues are mostly her own - and she has come far in facing this, and there is more to go - and cleanring this will help her enjoy a life of wholeness, acceptance and belonging <br/><br/>She love and is committed to God, And feels separated, feeling around in the dark, frustrated, angry, blaming in that relationship - when really the clouds blocking the Sun are her own - its really familiar - a lot like realtionship with other people<br/><br/>She is extraordinary in her gifts, how much she helps people, how she can meantially, empotionally, and spiritually see through to who they are and what they need - she doens't even know how gifted and powerful she is - And there is another level that calls her to much more, but doens't know how to move into this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>issues<br/>beloning<br/>isometircis in own system - so paowerful and capable, no one can hold her down but herself<br/>spiritual darkness - partly as a stage of soul development and partly stuck under crap that needs to move so can dance in the Light <br/>wants to make an even bigger difference, doesn't know how<br/>keeps trying to resolve core issues with old tools - needs new mind, new tools<br/>feels fejected and is rejecting others<br/>its like there is a chasm between her and the life she is born to live, the differeence she is born to make - and she doens't know how to get/build a brindge to get there...<br/>sadness <br/>loss<br/>feeling and being misunderstood<br/>always square peg in round hole<br/>wants to live in a whole new way of being; but stuck, resistant, hard to believe in a leap - only a step by step way (have to walk, not take a plane)<br/>has almost everything she needs to be a very powerful, successful spiritual director, soul counselor, deep healer - just needs some inner tools and some business support - and to really see who she is is Great, and so many are blessed to play with her<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
