                    <p><strong>What can we Learn from the Suffering of Mother Theresa? </strong>She made a beautiful difference in our world, and was stuck in her soul - NO ONE she went to knew how to help her. They thought she was in Dark Night  - that is ignorant CRAP. She was hooked by dogma and old paradigms of divine engagement.  SO many are hooked similarly, Stuck in Religion. HOW we can move forward, support ourselves and many to soul progress and release some of the friction we find in our world<br/>Is there something in the Looking Back = ‘Pillar of Salt’ Metaphor?</p>
