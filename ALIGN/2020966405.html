together</p><p>00:03</p><p>because you've been struggling through</p><p>00:06</p><p>heaviness</p><p>00:08</p><p>uh yeah i've been i've been struggling</p><p>00:11</p><p>quite a bit</p><p>00:12</p><p>um for for a long time but just recently</p><p>00:16</p><p>uh in particular i've been</p><p>00:19</p><p>i've been noticing i'm just very</p><p>00:21</p><p>agitated</p><p>00:22</p><p>and angry and not really very social or</p><p>00:27</p><p>easy to get along with</p><p>00:31</p><p>and um do you i just</p><p>00:35</p><p>i just want to check um you know we're</p><p>00:37</p><p>going to do</p><p>00:38</p><p>work in the soul um i just want to check</p><p>00:42</p><p>you're staying on top of all your</p><p>00:44</p><p>medical stuff</p><p>00:45</p><p>yes actually i just went to um</p><p>00:49</p><p>the doctor a couple days ago and i'm</p><p>00:52</p><p>going to have a</p><p>00:54</p><p>a neuro test and my uh the neurologist</p><p>00:58</p><p>said that</p><p>00:59</p><p>she thinks i have pseudo-depression</p><p>01:02</p><p>caused by lack of sleep so i</p><p>01:06</p><p>adjusted when i'm taking my medications</p><p>01:09</p><p>to the point where i'm actually taking</p><p>01:11</p><p>the ones at night that i'm supposed to</p><p>01:13</p><p>be taking at night</p><p>01:14</p><p>instead of everything during the day and</p><p>01:17</p><p>i think that's helped a little</p><p>01:19</p><p>and also my wife wanted me to try to</p><p>01:23</p><p>get my cpap back out and see if that</p><p>01:26</p><p>helps</p><p>01:27</p><p>and i've worn that a couple of nights</p><p>01:28</p><p>and i really don't like it so</p><p>01:30</p><p>um i'm going to try it again though</p><p>01:34</p><p>so you're only of course no you know it</p><p>01:37</p><p>sucks</p><p>01:37</p><p>um but does it help you sleep better or</p><p>01:40</p><p>does it keep you from sleeping</p><p>01:42</p><p>uh last night it really kept me from</p><p>01:44</p><p>sleeping</p><p>01:45</p><p>yeah uh the night before which is the</p><p>01:48</p><p>first night i really tried it</p><p>01:52</p><p>i don't think it bothered me too much</p><p>01:54</p><p>but last night it was making like</p><p>01:56</p><p>a gurgling sound in the hose and that</p><p>01:59</p><p>just kept me awake</p><p>02:00</p><p>yeah so i just took it off okay so</p><p>02:03</p><p>you're gonna talk to your doctor about</p><p>02:04</p><p>that</p><p>02:05</p><p>yeah and i i probably have to get uh a</p><p>02:08</p><p>new sleep study done</p><p>02:10</p><p>and maybe they'll recommend a different</p><p>02:12</p><p>cpap i don't know</p><p>02:15</p><p>okay and do you mind if i do this</p><p>02:16</p><p>medical thing because something medical</p><p>02:19</p><p>is up and i just want to clear that</p><p>02:21</p><p>before we go to the soul is that all</p><p>02:22</p><p>right</p><p>02:23</p><p>sure sure absolutely all right so um</p><p>02:26</p><p>uh you've been getting your heart</p><p>02:27</p><p>checked how's your heart</p><p>02:30</p><p>oh yeah it's fine i've been to my doctor</p><p>02:33</p><p>all my</p><p>02:34</p><p>uh numbers are good good enough you know</p><p>02:37</p><p>right in</p><p>02:38</p><p>in line except for i went and just had a</p><p>02:41</p><p>a a blood test because this</p><p>02:45</p><p>doctor said my b12 was low and it was</p><p>02:49</p><p>it was really low so i'm going to start</p><p>02:52</p><p>taking some supplements</p><p>02:54</p><p>for that and i might even get some</p><p>02:57</p><p>injections but my wife and i are</p><p>02:59</p><p>kind of haggling over what would be the</p><p>03:03</p><p>proper course because my doctor's office</p><p>03:06</p><p>i uh where i could get them through</p><p>03:09</p><p>there but it cost me over</p><p>03:11</p><p>a thousand dollars for four injections</p><p>03:13</p><p>no</p><p>03:14</p><p>yeah i know and and i went to a vitamin</p><p>03:18</p><p>store in the mall of where i go walking</p><p>03:21</p><p>and they can give me four injections for</p><p>03:24</p><p>um like 90 bucks or 75 bucks</p><p>03:28</p><p>and so i i want i i lean that way but</p><p>03:32</p><p>my wife is real skeptical because she</p><p>03:34</p><p>says they got skin in the game and</p><p>03:35</p><p>they're</p><p>03:36</p><p>trying to make a profit and i'm like the</p><p>03:38</p><p>doctor right</p><p>03:39</p><p>yeah exactly i i just i'm i'm not a fan</p><p>03:42</p><p>at all a big pharma</p><p>03:44</p><p>not at all right um</p><p>03:48</p><p>could i say something about the b12 sure</p><p>03:51</p><p>like if the doctor thinks um some</p><p>03:53</p><p>injections are good</p><p>03:55</p><p>great and uh i don't know maybe do a</p><p>03:58</p><p>little more research but</p><p>04:00</p><p>i don't see why it would be different</p><p>04:01</p><p>but whatever that's not you know</p><p>04:03</p><p>whatever</p><p>04:03</p><p>but saving nine hundred dollars</p><p>04:07</p><p>you can do a lot with 900 yeah</p><p>04:10</p><p>right um meanwhile uh</p><p>04:14</p><p>my naturopath recommended for me a</p><p>04:16</p><p>sublingual b12</p><p>04:18</p><p>um she told me that it gets in you know</p><p>04:21</p><p>because regular b12 has trouble getting</p><p>04:23</p><p>getting in um so if you want</p><p>04:26</p><p>um ping me after and i'll send you the</p><p>04:29</p><p>information what i mean it's not</p><p>04:30</p><p>expensive</p><p>04:31</p><p>um and at least you know you can take</p><p>04:33</p><p>that daily and even if only a little</p><p>04:34</p><p>gets in it helps</p><p>04:35</p><p>right uh my my wife we get</p><p>04:39</p><p>uh a shipment monthly i think from hap</p><p>04:43</p><p>our insurance and it's free so</p><p>04:47</p><p>we ordered some supplements um</p><p>04:50</p><p>some slow release b12 that you put on</p><p>04:53</p><p>your tongue</p><p>04:54</p><p>and it dissolves great and and they're</p><p>04:57</p><p>five</p><p>04:57</p><p>five thousand micrograms which may be</p><p>05:01</p><p>too much</p><p>05:02</p><p>but i guess b12 just if</p><p>05:05</p><p>if it doesn't get absorbed it just goes</p><p>05:07</p><p>out of the body anyway so</p><p>05:10</p><p>yeah great okay good um and</p><p>05:13</p><p>uh i'm just the thing that</p><p>05:17</p><p>there's just something bother you you</p><p>05:19</p><p>don't have like a pacemaker or anything</p><p>05:22</p><p>like that right</p><p>05:23</p><p>no there's something i don't know it</p><p>05:26</p><p>just won't go away</p><p>05:28</p><p>it's like to the side of the heart and</p><p>05:30</p><p>it's like</p><p>05:31</p><p>i have got electrical feel or maybe</p><p>05:33</p><p>nerves or something is there any reason</p><p>05:35</p><p>why</p><p>05:36</p><p>i would have a hit on anything like that</p><p>05:39</p><p>uh i don't quite think i heard what you</p><p>05:42</p><p>said</p><p>05:44</p><p>i'm getting a hit i'm getting some kind</p><p>05:46</p><p>of impression</p><p>05:47</p><p>of uh um something it's like</p><p>05:50</p><p>electrical or nerve ish ner you know</p><p>05:53</p><p>electrical or nerve</p><p>05:54</p><p>to the side of your heart like to the</p><p>05:57</p><p>side</p><p>05:58</p><p>the left side i can't read it it's one</p><p>06:02</p><p>i'm not sure one one of the sides</p><p>06:04</p><p>is there anything um that would</p><p>06:07</p><p>be a reason for that that you can</p><p>06:08</p><p>imagine</p><p>06:10</p><p>not really okay</p><p>06:19</p><p>all right i'm just going to go on but if</p><p>06:21</p><p>i get a hit on anything else about it</p><p>06:22</p><p>i'll let you know</p><p>06:23</p><p>but there's something it's like i'm</p><p>06:25</p><p>getting uh um</p><p>06:28</p><p>it's related to</p><p>06:31</p><p>my aura it's something physical it's</p><p>06:35</p><p>like</p><p>06:36</p><p>it's related to you know um it's like</p><p>06:40</p><p>i'm not saying it is it's</p><p>06:41</p><p>like with the um sleep apnea</p><p>06:44</p><p>where uh like you</p><p>06:48</p><p>aren't getting what you need or</p><p>06:49</p><p>something's going right in the body and</p><p>06:51</p><p>then the body jolts itself</p><p>06:54</p><p>there's the jewel and that's f that</p><p>06:56</p><p>brings fear right it brings fear because</p><p>06:58</p><p>it brings adrenaline or whatever the</p><p>06:59</p><p>reason that's why you need a</p><p>07:01</p><p>cpap right because you have</p><p>07:04</p><p>trouble breathing and it wakes you up it</p><p>07:07</p><p>it doesn't just wake you up it startles</p><p>07:09</p><p>you awake</p><p>07:11</p><p>um i haven't felt that in a long time</p><p>07:14</p><p>anything like that because i used to do</p><p>07:16</p><p>that when i was sleeping i</p><p>07:18</p><p>get startled awake but uh</p><p>07:21</p><p>i guess there maybe has been a couple</p><p>07:23</p><p>times</p><p>07:24</p><p>um right recently what i'm thinking</p><p>07:28</p><p>i couldn't think that</p><p>07:31</p><p>that that's actually true but but um</p><p>07:34</p><p>but you've experienced it before in the</p><p>07:37</p><p>past</p><p>07:38</p><p>i have but a lot of times it was just</p><p>07:41</p><p>because of reflux</p><p>07:43</p><p>yeah right okay that does the same thing</p><p>07:45</p><p>reflects kind of like startles you awake</p><p>07:47</p><p>right it's like</p><p>07:48</p><p>you're sleeping and then whoa i'm awake</p><p>07:51</p><p>that that startlement yeah what i'm</p><p>07:55</p><p>pointing to</p><p>07:56</p><p>it's i'm not talking about i'm not</p><p>07:58</p><p>talking about</p><p>07:59</p><p>reflex or sleep apnea i'm talking about</p><p>08:01</p><p>the startlingness</p><p>08:04</p><p>and how that weight like it's startling</p><p>08:07</p><p>and then you</p><p>08:08</p><p>it like it's fear fear-bringing</p><p>08:12</p><p>like it's like there's that fear</p><p>08:13</p><p>reaction that awake</p><p>08:15</p><p>when you were sleeping feeling does that</p><p>08:17</p><p>make sense that's what i'm pointing to</p><p>08:18</p><p>make sense i just i just don't know if</p><p>08:20</p><p>that's</p><p>08:21</p><p>actually what happens but i'll try to</p><p>08:25</p><p>um watch for it in it when i wake up at</p><p>08:28</p><p>night</p><p>08:30</p><p>no no no okay so just erase the</p><p>08:31</p><p>whiteboard</p><p>08:33</p><p>nothing i said maybe just erase it all</p><p>08:35</p><p>so all i'm saying is that</p><p>08:36</p><p>that experience of startlement</p><p>08:40</p><p>is there's something going on your</p><p>08:42</p><p>system saying</p><p>08:43</p><p>startle</p><p>08:46</p><p>and um it's bringing</p><p>08:50</p><p>fear of course it's bringing um</p><p>08:56</p><p>fear unsettlement vulnerability</p><p>09:00</p><p>uh can i interject something here yeah</p><p>09:02</p><p>please</p><p>09:03</p><p>um there has been a number of times</p><p>09:06</p><p>when i've been asleep and i heard</p><p>09:10</p><p>what i thought it sounded exactly like</p><p>09:12</p><p>my wife</p><p>09:14</p><p>yelling john wake up</p><p>09:18</p><p>and uh there's no one there</p><p>09:21</p><p>it's it's not her it's just i hear it</p><p>09:24</p><p>and i startled myself awake that way</p><p>09:28</p><p>that that has happened and i have woken</p><p>09:31</p><p>up kind of startled</p><p>09:32</p><p>the past couple of mornings kind of</p><p>09:35</p><p>startled</p><p>09:36</p><p>but not really but i'm looking at two</p><p>09:39</p><p>different walls</p><p>09:41</p><p>uh when i woke up one on each time</p><p>09:44</p><p>and there's writing on the wall and i</p><p>09:47</p><p>can't read it</p><p>09:49</p><p>but it's obviously it's there it's</p><p>09:51</p><p>writing</p><p>09:53</p><p>so i'm just i'm just i'm feeling like</p><p>09:56</p><p>what the</p><p>09:57</p><p>hell's going on what the [ __ ] is going</p><p>10:01</p><p>on</p><p>10:02</p><p>yeah yeah let's just be real</p><p>10:05</p><p>okay and now we're merging into the soul</p><p>10:09</p><p>experience</p><p>10:10</p><p>so we'll go there but it's affecting</p><p>10:12</p><p>your body</p><p>10:13</p><p>whatever is happening so i i would like</p><p>10:15</p><p>you to</p><p>10:18</p><p>i don't want to scare you in any way but</p><p>10:19</p><p>there's just something</p><p>10:21</p><p>that is affecting your body being</p><p>10:24</p><p>startled</p><p>10:25</p><p>we're going to go in the soul and which</p><p>10:26</p><p>obviously you've got stuff</p><p>10:28</p><p>you know yeah i mean from the future</p><p>10:30</p><p>experiences</p><p>10:33</p><p>um to get your attention</p><p>10:36</p><p>and um i i just i have a feel</p><p>10:40</p><p>it means certainly affecting your body</p><p>10:42</p><p>but um</p><p>10:43</p><p>i just just watch</p><p>10:48</p><p>watch for what i said that like</p><p>10:50</p><p>electrical thing if you get any kind of</p><p>10:52</p><p>hit about it do something</p><p>10:53</p><p>okay okay um i</p><p>10:56</p><p>i have had something like that before</p><p>10:59</p><p>but</p><p>11:00</p><p>and i'm getting it recently a kind of</p><p>11:03</p><p>like an</p><p>11:04</p><p>electric feeling a discharge in my jaw</p><p>11:07</p><p>and teeth</p><p>11:08</p><p>but it was the last time it was from</p><p>11:11</p><p>a medication i was taking and i'm not</p><p>11:13</p><p>taking it anymore</p><p>11:14</p><p>but i am taking like</p><p>11:19</p><p>10 or 11 different medications now so</p><p>11:23</p><p>it could still be something like that</p><p>11:25</p><p>causing</p><p>11:26</p><p>a medical problem yeah there's just um</p><p>11:31</p><p>it's like too much communication nerve</p><p>11:35</p><p>communication</p><p>11:36</p><p>or and or too much electrical charge</p><p>11:39</p><p>and or yeah so just just</p><p>11:43</p><p>nothing to be worried about but just if</p><p>11:45</p><p>you have anything that's like</p><p>11:47</p><p>oh wendy talked about this electrical</p><p>11:50</p><p>charge thing</p><p>11:51</p><p>now i know what she's talking about be</p><p>11:53</p><p>like oh now i know what she's talking</p><p>11:55</p><p>about is there's something to do about</p><p>11:56</p><p>it so that my body cannot be so</p><p>11:58</p><p>hyper vigilant so hyper</p><p>12:02</p><p>up you know because that leads to no</p><p>12:04</p><p>sleep it leads to</p><p>12:05</p><p>fear okay um which leads to anger</p><p>12:12</p><p>i just have to kill somebody now</p><p>12:15</p><p>there's definitely fight or flight going</p><p>12:16</p><p>on and you know that</p><p>12:18</p><p>um that's called the sympathetic nervous</p><p>12:22</p><p>system i don't know if you're familiar</p><p>12:24</p><p>that's the fight or flight or freeze</p><p>12:26</p><p>yeah right and that's where a lot of</p><p>12:28</p><p>people</p><p>12:29</p><p>spend their time in our society but we</p><p>12:31</p><p>belong in the opposite</p><p>12:33</p><p>the this parasympathetic where that's</p><p>12:36</p><p>uh rest and digest right and</p><p>12:40</p><p>so and so there's something about your</p><p>12:42</p><p>system cert will go to the soul and that</p><p>12:44</p><p>makes sense that there's stuff startling</p><p>12:45</p><p>you</p><p>12:46</p><p>but in the body they're startling in</p><p>12:48</p><p>that that's very</p><p>12:49</p><p>uncomfortable because it just doesn't</p><p>12:51</p><p>you you understand when you don't get</p><p>12:53</p><p>enough rest or sleep</p><p>12:54</p><p>it um it causes all kinds of hay</p><p>12:56</p><p>wiredness</p><p>12:57</p><p>yeah yeah okay great so i'll get out of</p><p>13:00</p><p>the body and unless it</p><p>13:01</p><p>um it comes back but uh so</p><p>13:05</p><p>um beautiful part is that you have some</p><p>13:08</p><p>tools you've done some workshops with me</p><p>13:10</p><p>and i am thrilled you know the other day</p><p>13:12</p><p>you said and it was so good for me</p><p>13:14</p><p>because you said</p><p>13:15</p><p>you know i don't talk much in groups</p><p>13:22</p><p>because in person you're much more</p><p>13:24</p><p>loquacious so thank you</p><p>13:27</p><p>that's not a problem i just i just fear</p><p>13:31</p><p>um not being able to say what i want to</p><p>13:34</p><p>say</p><p>13:35</p><p>right and people not understanding</p><p>13:38</p><p>because i know i have a tendency to</p><p>13:43</p><p>have to really think before i speak</p><p>13:47</p><p>yeah especially especially with my wife</p><p>13:52</p><p>i don't like to say anything to her</p><p>13:57</p><p>i hear you sometimes we get you know the</p><p>14:00</p><p>nerves</p><p>14:00</p><p>that we get on each other's soft parts</p><p>14:04</p><p>and then ow</p><p>14:08</p><p>okay so um so let's do a few tools which</p><p>14:10</p><p>is why i usually start but i just got</p><p>14:12</p><p>hit with your body stuff</p><p>14:13</p><p>um so let's let's notice that we're</p><p>14:16</p><p>actually here in our bodies and we're</p><p>14:18</p><p>actually connected to the earth</p><p>14:20</p><p>and we're releasing what we're done with</p><p>14:22</p><p>like sand in our hands to the earth</p><p>14:25</p><p>gorgeous you're good at this gorgeous</p><p>14:27</p><p>and just breathe let's breathe in from</p><p>14:30</p><p>the universe breathe fill your chest and</p><p>14:32</p><p>belly</p><p>14:33</p><p>and exhale down your grounding to the</p><p>14:36</p><p>center of the earth gorgeous</p><p>14:38</p><p>wow you're so energetically capable and</p><p>14:41</p><p>i just want to encourage you about this</p><p>14:42</p><p>just keep breathing</p><p>14:43</p><p>breathe in breathe your co-fill your</p><p>14:45</p><p>chest feel your belly</p><p>14:47</p><p>release that breath through the center</p><p>14:49</p><p>of the ear just keep doing that</p><p>14:50</p><p>i just want to validate for you um</p><p>14:53</p><p>one of the things is that's going on for</p><p>14:57</p><p>you is</p><p>14:59</p><p>spiritual you know we're all spirit</p><p>15:00</p><p>we're all</p><p>15:02</p><p>we're all there we're all jesus in</p><p>15:04</p><p>heavenly places it's already done we're</p><p>15:06</p><p>already loved</p><p>15:07</p><p>this second i was where i was i was</p><p>15:10</p><p>turning up the</p><p>15:11</p><p>volume okay so we're already we're</p><p>15:14</p><p>already spirit we're already there we're</p><p>15:15</p><p>already seated with</p><p>15:17</p><p>jesus in heavenly places we're already</p><p>15:19</p><p>uh light and love and truth</p><p>15:21</p><p>and then we're learning to bring heaven</p><p>15:23</p><p>to earth we're learning to</p><p>15:25</p><p>be light in the body um we're</p><p>15:28</p><p>learning to do what jesus did to be</p><p>15:30</p><p>divine presence</p><p>15:31</p><p>in flesh yep</p><p>15:34</p><p>and so you're in your soul journey like</p><p>15:37</p><p>everybody else</p><p>15:38</p><p>and um you've you've ratcheted</p><p>15:42</p><p>in your actual extra experience and your</p><p>15:45</p><p>actual soul</p><p>15:46</p><p>behavior very you know you're really</p><p>15:50</p><p>like fast and capable and there and</p><p>15:52</p><p>doing it</p><p>15:54</p><p>um and then your</p><p>15:57</p><p>consciousness though of that is</p><p>16:00</p><p>lagging behind very normal so</p><p>16:04</p><p>i'm sitting here and i'm watching you</p><p>16:06</p><p>and i'm saying all right</p><p>16:07</p><p>let's let's ground and let go to the</p><p>16:09</p><p>earth and you're doing i say let's just</p><p>16:11</p><p>make it more real both of breath</p><p>16:13</p><p>and you're doing it and in your</p><p>16:16</p><p>consciousness</p><p>16:17</p><p>let me just see where you are i don't</p><p>16:19</p><p>think you're as</p><p>16:20</p><p>as knowing hey you turned around you</p><p>16:23</p><p>turned again i did</p><p>16:26</p><p>i had to i had to pick up my phone let</p><p>16:29</p><p>me turn it again</p><p>16:30</p><p>i had to pick up my phone to turn the</p><p>16:32</p><p>volume up</p><p>16:33</p><p>and everything went haywire okay okay</p><p>16:36</p><p>that's perfect perfect we're on the same</p><p>16:38</p><p>page now so</p><p>16:39</p><p>it consciously when i say</p><p>16:42</p><p>be here now and connect to the earth</p><p>16:44</p><p>release to the earth what do you</p><p>16:46</p><p>notice in your in your subtle subtly</p><p>16:49</p><p>what do you notice in your soul</p><p>16:51</p><p>uh nothing i figured</p><p>16:55</p><p>right you're just like she babbles along</p><p>16:57</p><p>and then she tells me i'm doing great</p><p>16:59</p><p>i'm like that's nice wendy</p><p>17:03</p><p>i just i just don't know if i have any</p><p>17:05</p><p>perception in that area</p><p>17:07</p><p>yes so so what my perception of you</p><p>17:10</p><p>that's part of my job is to validate</p><p>17:12</p><p>what</p><p>17:12</p><p>you know because i can i can see maybe</p><p>17:15</p><p>what you can't right yet</p><p>17:16</p><p>because i work with a ton of people and</p><p>17:18</p><p>some of them are</p><p>17:20</p><p>you know just are not to the place where</p><p>17:22</p><p>they can do what you're doing</p><p>17:24</p><p>and but you are you're just in your</p><p>17:27</p><p>consciousness and you're</p><p>17:28</p><p>part of it you're you know you're so</p><p>17:30</p><p>body's identified and</p><p>17:32</p><p>that's normal it's normal but you're</p><p>17:34</p><p>making the turn in your soul</p><p>17:36</p><p>to become more conscious of what is</p><p>17:40</p><p>below your everyday consciousness</p><p>17:42</p><p>yeah yes so just</p><p>17:45</p><p>yes and so sure whatever whatever you</p><p>17:48</p><p>want to call it</p><p>17:49</p><p>so um so it makes sense to me that in</p><p>17:52</p><p>your dreams because</p><p>17:55</p><p>you know visions and dreams are</p><p>17:56</p><p>basically the same thing</p><p>17:58</p><p>okay um except for visions</p><p>18:01</p><p>we are conscious for</p><p>18:05</p><p>okay and dreams we are sleeping</p><p>18:08</p><p>here for but we get it on that</p><p>18:12</p><p>we get it in the astral or in the dream</p><p>18:16</p><p>time and um so</p><p>18:19</p><p>i see i'm just looking at you in the</p><p>18:20</p><p>astral and you're dancing and singing</p><p>18:22</p><p>you're so free</p><p>18:24</p><p>it's like i would say</p><p>18:29</p><p>it's interesting because you you know</p><p>18:31</p><p>you have a strong male</p><p>18:33</p><p>affect um</p><p>18:37</p><p>you mean you look like a man right</p><p>18:41</p><p>and you um you know you're a little bit</p><p>18:44</p><p>more</p><p>18:45</p><p>quiet like men are and you've got a nice</p><p>18:47</p><p>deep voice and you know you</p><p>18:49</p><p>you present as a man you're cisgendered</p><p>18:52</p><p>um and to do</p><p>18:56</p><p>that in our society especially america</p><p>18:58</p><p>it means taking</p><p>19:00</p><p>other parts of yourself and like</p><p>19:02</p><p>de-emphasizing</p><p>19:03</p><p>them okay does that make sense</p><p>19:06</p><p>the more yeah some of the emotional some</p><p>19:08</p><p>of the</p><p>19:10</p><p>com you know natural compassion whatever</p><p>19:13</p><p>some of the parts that</p><p>19:14</p><p>the more overt compassion i mean men are</p><p>19:16</p><p>great right men are awesome</p><p>19:18</p><p>and in our society men are trained to be</p><p>19:22</p><p>um shut up emotions shut up uh</p><p>19:27</p><p>fluffy things so yeah anyway</p><p>19:32</p><p>yeah yeah it's your life</p><p>19:35</p><p>it's um so what i see</p><p>19:38</p><p>funny funny is i look at you in the</p><p>19:40</p><p>astral and it's like</p><p>19:42</p><p>colors and um</p><p>19:46</p><p>skipping like like</p><p>19:49</p><p>bringing in more of the feminine energy</p><p>19:51</p><p>because masculine feminine you know two</p><p>19:53</p><p>two wings of the bird we're all we all</p><p>19:55</p><p>have the both</p><p>19:56</p><p>right right and and i would like to</p><p>19:58</p><p>astral there's a lot</p><p>19:59</p><p>of ownership of the feminine yeah i</p><p>20:02</p><p>would like to get</p><p>20:03</p><p>that because i at one time thought i</p><p>20:06</p><p>actually had</p><p>20:07</p><p>um mo well i had more of it when i was</p><p>20:11</p><p>young</p><p>20:12</p><p>and as i got older i just</p><p>20:16</p><p>stopped yes you know so</p><p>20:20</p><p>yeah i want to get back there yeah i</p><p>20:23</p><p>just want to get back society does this</p><p>20:25</p><p>to us</p><p>20:25</p><p>so that it's it's the socialization in</p><p>20:28</p><p>our society of men</p><p>20:30</p><p>uh women get it differently um so yes of</p><p>20:33</p><p>course</p><p>20:34</p><p>when you were young you had it you know</p><p>20:35</p><p>you had more um natural</p><p>20:37</p><p>uh like nurturance</p><p>20:40</p><p>and playfulness and like a desire</p><p>20:43</p><p>to access like beauty like the flouncy</p><p>20:48</p><p>colorful beauty yeah that's my read you</p><p>20:51</p><p>can</p><p>20:51</p><p>i mean it's your life but that's what</p><p>20:53</p><p>i'm noticing so anything that's one</p><p>20:55</p><p>thing</p><p>20:55</p><p>in in the astral you have been re-owning</p><p>20:58</p><p>your</p><p>20:59</p><p>uh feminine energy which is very healthy</p><p>21:03</p><p>uh all</p><p>21:04</p><p>healthy human beings have both no matter</p><p>21:06</p><p>what our gender identity is</p><p>21:08</p><p>so um so that's really cool and that</p><p>21:12</p><p>looks really nurturing and i see you</p><p>21:14</p><p>like in the astrals drinking in of pools</p><p>21:17</p><p>of of water which is you know a feminine</p><p>21:20</p><p>uh kind of image uh sometimes they</p><p>21:24</p><p>call water like emotions or the soul so</p><p>21:27</p><p>that looks really great i i don't</p><p>21:28</p><p>usually</p><p>21:29</p><p>read like this but this is just so</p><p>21:31</p><p>dominant in your astral experience</p><p>21:33</p><p>so um it's just a matter of your</p><p>21:40</p><p>allowing um and if you want from the</p><p>21:43</p><p>center of your head just</p><p>21:44</p><p>just because i say that and i'm doing it</p><p>21:46</p><p>you're just you're going to do it</p><p>21:48</p><p>center of head and just let um</p><p>21:52</p><p>i'd like to break sticks so you can do</p><p>21:53</p><p>that with your actual hands to make it</p><p>21:55</p><p>real for you</p><p>21:56</p><p>just like really really thin easy</p><p>21:59</p><p>um dry sticks</p><p>22:02</p><p>in your hands in your lap or whatever um</p><p>22:06</p><p>and also on your screen energetically</p><p>22:09</p><p>you can break them good</p><p>22:13</p><p>and we're breaking your old patterns of</p><p>22:16</p><p>um</p><p>22:16</p><p>pushing the feminine to the shadow</p><p>22:20</p><p>are you familiar with the idea of the</p><p>22:21</p><p>shadow the jungian idea that we</p><p>22:24</p><p>separate ourselves so i tend to read</p><p>22:27</p><p>that behind</p><p>22:28</p><p>us and so just with breaking the sticks</p><p>22:30</p><p>we're just saying i'm taking i'm just</p><p>22:31</p><p>wanting to take one little</p><p>22:33</p><p>speck of sand out of</p><p>22:36</p><p>my unconsciousness to my consciousness</p><p>22:39</p><p>one little</p><p>22:41</p><p>um piece of pink</p><p>22:44</p><p>one little one little uh crinoline piece</p><p>22:48</p><p>one little you know beautiful weird</p><p>22:51</p><p>things that women like</p><p>22:53</p><p>um out of my uh</p><p>22:56</p><p>out of my shadow into my consciousness</p><p>23:05</p><p>good and i'm willing now with the same</p><p>23:07</p><p>breaking i'm willing to become more</p><p>23:10</p><p>conscious</p><p>23:10</p><p>of what's right below the surface and</p><p>23:13</p><p>there's this big</p><p>23:14</p><p>um holding on to the male to the male</p><p>23:17</p><p>presentation uh and a lot of pain under</p><p>23:20</p><p>there i'm seeing so</p><p>23:22</p><p>it looks to me like you probably had</p><p>23:24</p><p>more than one but</p><p>23:25</p><p>um more a few big</p><p>23:29</p><p>punches in the jaw not not literally</p><p>23:33</p><p>that said you know get with the program</p><p>23:35</p><p>boy it's time to be a man</p><p>23:37</p><p>it's time to you know and um</p><p>23:40</p><p>we we won't have any of that we won't</p><p>23:44</p><p>have any of that</p><p>23:45</p><p>boyish girlish stuff out of you</p><p>23:48</p><p>and um that's very harmful so</p><p>23:51</p><p>uh that's part of the not wanting the to</p><p>23:54</p><p>under to</p><p>23:55</p><p>experience the soul because</p><p>23:57</p><p>unfortunately in our society the soul</p><p>23:59</p><p>has been</p><p>24:00</p><p>associated with the feminine and in some</p><p>24:03</p><p>ways</p><p>24:04</p><p>our receptivity is feminine but the soul</p><p>24:07</p><p>is not feminine</p><p>24:08</p><p>so maybe just let's get understand that</p><p>24:11</p><p>and just break sticks</p><p>24:12</p><p>soul is not feminine the soul has</p><p>24:14</p><p>receptivity</p><p>24:16</p><p>and it also has activity</p><p>24:20</p><p>okay yeah break sticks and you can</p><p>24:23</p><p>identify with the active part of the</p><p>24:25</p><p>soul</p><p>24:25</p><p>for the choosing the chooser to that for</p><p>24:28</p><p>the actor for the sayer for the goer</p><p>24:31</p><p>and um and i'm just gonna i have i have</p><p>24:34</p><p>like</p><p>24:34</p><p>something i'm very hard on i'm gonna</p><p>24:37</p><p>tell you because it might help you</p><p>24:39</p><p>um our our religions</p><p>24:44</p><p>have been designed mostly by men for</p><p>24:47</p><p>men um our religions and ours</p><p>24:50</p><p>and our spiritual practices and so</p><p>24:54</p><p>what men tend to need uh cisgendered men</p><p>24:57</p><p>tend to need is more</p><p>24:58</p><p>receptivity and so everybody's told be</p><p>25:02</p><p>more receptive let</p><p>25:04</p><p>go let go let go there they're trying to</p><p>25:06</p><p>get</p><p>25:08</p><p>the male to accept the feminine in way</p><p>25:10</p><p>without saying it</p><p>25:12</p><p>um and unfortunately</p><p>25:15</p><p>for women that is not helpful because we</p><p>25:18</p><p>already do this a lot and what we need</p><p>25:20</p><p>is this</p><p>25:23</p><p>and um and for men</p><p>25:26</p><p>it's hard because</p><p>25:29</p><p>we get

little porthole</p><p>30:20</p><p>let me just break sticks and give myself</p><p>30:22</p><p>like a 360 view</p><p>30:24</p><p>around my around my head so i can see</p><p>30:27</p><p>all around i can see the moon and the</p><p>30:29</p><p>stars and the earth and i can see</p><p>30:30</p><p>everything and break sticks and let it</p><p>30:34</p><p>be</p><p>30:36</p><p>i can see i can hear i can see</p><p>30:47</p><p>good and</p><p>30:50</p><p>another fascinating thing and it's it's</p><p>30:52</p><p>really clear in you</p><p>30:54</p><p>um and this is unfortunately this</p><p>30:58</p><p>i mean men men do this to everyone but</p><p>31:01</p><p>but women especially uh moms especially</p><p>31:04</p><p>wives we</p><p>31:08</p><p>women want</p><p>31:12</p><p>you to be men and we want you</p><p>31:15</p><p>to kind of be on a leash</p><p>31:18</p><p>i want you not quite to have your full</p><p>31:20</p><p>range</p><p>31:21</p><p>of everything and just notice that the</p><p>31:25</p><p>the the rocket is just the rocket blast</p><p>31:28</p><p>whatever the heck that's called i'm</p><p>31:29</p><p>gonna call it the rocket blast it's</p><p>31:30</p><p>going all the way to the center of the</p><p>31:32</p><p>earth</p><p>31:33</p><p>and you are safe and you're here in the</p><p>31:35</p><p>driver's seat you can hear</p><p>31:37</p><p>you can see and the next thing that</p><p>31:39</p><p>comes up is your will</p><p>31:40</p><p>your free will and just break sticks i</p><p>31:44</p><p>see it all the time with men all the</p><p>31:46</p><p>time i do deep work</p><p>31:47</p><p>uh with men and um eventually most men</p><p>31:51</p><p>it but here it's right here for you</p><p>31:54</p><p>usually takes a few sessions</p><p>31:56</p><p>but you're just like i have a 10 foot</p><p>31:58</p><p>leash that's what i've got</p><p>32:00</p><p>you know you're a big dog with a big</p><p>32:02</p><p>bark and a big bite you know you're nice</p><p>32:04</p><p>like pitbull guy you know</p><p>32:07</p><p>but um with a big you know collar</p><p>32:11</p><p>and that's what you're allowed to have</p><p>32:12</p><p>you're not allowed to have the pink</p><p>32:13</p><p>collar or anything</p><p>32:15</p><p>but um but</p><p>32:18</p><p>you get a 10 fresh leash it's [ __ ]</p><p>32:21</p><p>so just break sticks it's [ __ ]</p><p>32:26</p><p>it's like you have to be strong and you</p><p>32:29</p><p>have to be this</p><p>32:30</p><p>and you have to be that but you're not</p><p>32:31</p><p>allowed to really use it</p><p>32:34</p><p>so let's just break sticks enough of</p><p>32:36</p><p>that i'm taking off</p><p>32:39</p><p>i'm taking off i'm breaking the thing</p><p>32:41</p><p>just between you and me and the apple</p><p>32:43</p><p>tree nobody knows</p><p>32:45</p><p>and you're just gonna take off the</p><p>32:48</p><p>collar</p><p>32:49</p><p>let the um lead it's really the lead</p><p>32:52</p><p>since the issue but we can take off the</p><p>32:54</p><p>collar</p><p>32:54</p><p>which affects your throat and your</p><p>32:56</p><p>ability to say and your ability to</p><p>32:57</p><p>create</p><p>32:58</p><p>but really it also really hooks into</p><p>33:01</p><p>um like your root it really hooks into</p><p>33:04</p><p>survival</p><p>33:05</p><p>oh to survive i have to stay with the</p><p>33:09</p><p>you know i have to stay in the box i've</p><p>33:11</p><p>seen the rules</p><p>33:12</p><p>of the family of the society of the</p><p>33:15</p><p>of the different parts of society the</p><p>33:18</p><p>church</p><p>33:19</p><p>the school the people and let's just</p><p>33:22</p><p>break that</p><p>33:22</p><p>you are an adult and the law is for</p><p>33:25</p><p>children</p><p>33:26</p><p>and so just break sticks and</p><p>33:29</p><p>spirit is the way break sticks and let's</p><p>33:32</p><p>allow um i can't see you but i hope you</p><p>33:35</p><p>can hear me</p><p>33:36</p><p>allow the root to let go of the</p><p>33:39</p><p>that that leash good and it's</p><p>33:43</p><p>you're it's replaced by your the rocket</p><p>33:46</p><p>blast</p><p>33:47</p><p>i am an adult in the center of my head</p><p>33:50</p><p>an adult body</p><p>33:51</p><p>as an adult soul and i am grounded to</p><p>33:55</p><p>the earth</p><p>33:56</p><p>i can be trusted i can make my own</p><p>33:59</p><p>choices</p><p>34:00</p><p>i'm not going to bite the male the mail</p><p>34:03</p><p>carrier</p><p>34:04</p><p>i i i'm fine

noticing anything</p><p>36:49</p><p>there's no answers frustration of not</p><p>36:52</p><p>being able to imagine</p><p>36:53</p><p>things as you're talking i i just really</p><p>36:57</p><p>can't</p><p>37:00</p><p>understand or connect with trying to get</p><p>37:03</p><p>into</p><p>37:04</p><p>breaking a stick or getting into the</p><p>37:06</p><p>center of my head</p><p>37:07</p><p>or visualizing a rocket or anything</p><p>37:10</p><p>like that i just my visualizations</p><p>37:13</p><p>are almost non-existent um</p><p>37:18</p><p>and i've always been like that i i just</p><p>37:20</p><p>i just didn't have any</p><p>37:21</p><p>any ability to visualize things</p><p>37:30</p><p>so what is what's your work been john</p><p>37:32</p><p>what do you do</p><p>37:33</p><p>for a living what have you done for a</p><p>37:35</p><p>living</p><p>37:37</p><p>a second everything</p><p>37:42</p><p>uh okay i had done many different things</p><p>37:46</p><p>but the last thing i did i was a uh</p><p>37:50</p><p>heating and cooling technician at the</p><p>37:53</p><p>detroit zoo</p><p>37:57</p><p>yeah i i've loved i loved being at with</p><p>38:00</p><p>the animals</p><p>38:02</p><p>didn't like being with the people but i</p><p>38:05</p><p>hear you um</p><p>38:08</p><p>so you'd go in and like there'd be</p><p>38:11</p><p>something that needed to be replaced or</p><p>38:12</p><p>whatever and</p><p>38:14</p><p>you'd have to fix it</p><p>38:17</p><p>yeah that that's what i was supposed to</p><p>38:19</p><p>do</p><p>38:20</p><p>yep didn't necessarily always do that</p><p>38:23</p><p>but</p><p>38:24</p><p>you know i did a lot of goofing off and</p><p>38:27</p><p>i really</p><p>38:28</p><p>got into some horrible work habits and i</p><p>38:31</p><p>hated myself for it so</p><p>38:33</p><p>anyway a lot of hating on though</p><p>38:38</p><p>jobs yeah</p><p>38:41</p><p>yeah you've been there's a lot of um</p><p>38:46</p><p>sliminess thickness in your space it's</p><p>38:48</p><p>hard to</p><p>38:49</p><p>it's hard to act it's hard to do stuff</p><p>38:52</p><p>um and that's what you've been</p><p>38:55</p><p>encouraged to do so it's a rock and a</p><p>38:57</p><p>hard place</p><p>38:58</p><p>um i'm just see like so you</p><p>39:02</p><p>when you did the job you'd go and you'd</p><p>39:04</p><p>see oh</p><p>39:05</p><p>this needs a new this or that or it</p><p>39:07</p><p>needs you know i need to</p><p>39:09</p><p>you know bring this around like i don't</p><p>39:11</p><p>know i'm not gonna have the words but</p><p>39:12</p><p>you have to bring the thing</p><p>39:14</p><p>from here to there i bring the heating</p><p>39:15</p><p>cooler</p><p>39:17</p><p>you have to replace this part or i would</p><p>39:19</p><p>have to tighten that belt or i'd have to</p><p>39:21</p><p>do something</p><p>39:22</p><p>was there ever anything that you had to</p><p>39:25</p><p>do</p><p>39:25</p><p>oh it can't go that way anymore i have</p><p>39:27</p><p>to bring it around the other way i have</p><p>39:29</p><p>to create a new thing</p><p>39:33</p><p>i was just fixing mostly just fixing</p><p>39:40</p><p>i don't know if i had to create anything</p><p>39:43</p><p>i i sometimes had to improvise</p><p>39:47</p><p>okay okay because i don't have a</p><p>39:51</p><p>left-handed thing i have to use two</p><p>39:53</p><p>right-handed things or whatever</p><p>39:56</p><p>and when you see that</p><p>39:59</p><p>would you just use your knowing you just</p><p>40:01</p><p>know oh i</p><p>40:02</p><p>i don't have this i know i need that but</p><p>40:04</p><p>you wouldn't see it you just know it</p><p>40:07</p><p>yeah yeah yeah</p><p>40:10</p><p>so that's knowingness and that we didn't</p><p>40:12</p><p>have to clear because it's already fine</p><p>40:15</p><p>that's the crown crown information and</p><p>40:18</p><p>of course we know with our brains we say</p><p>40:20</p><p>oh i know that</p><p>40:21</p><p>you know with our intellect but i'm not</p><p>40:22</p><p>talking about that i'm talking about the</p><p>40:24</p><p>soul capacity of just knowing the truth</p><p>40:27</p><p>or knowing</p><p>40:28</p><p>what needs to be happening knowing your</p><p>40:32</p><p>i used to be very much intuitive</p><p>40:35</p><p>in fact i do recall one time when i did</p><p>40:38</p><p>a different job</p><p>40:39</p><p>i told my boss something and he said</p><p>40:41</p><p>well how do you know that</p><p>40:43</p><p>and i i couldn't explain it i just knew</p><p>40:45</p><p>it and</p><p>40:46</p><p>and later on in the week</p><p>40:50</p><p>i got back into a similar area</p><p>40:55</p><p>and i noticed what it was that triggered</p><p>40:57</p><p>it so</p><p>40:58</p><p>then i found out that there was actually</p><p>41:00</p><p>a thermometer</p><p>41:02</p><p>that i saw that was not giving me</p><p>41:06</p><p>that was was not verifying information</p><p>41:09</p><p>so i i instinctively knew that</p><p>41:13</p><p>i needed uh to do something other than</p><p>41:17</p><p>what i normally would be told to do yes</p><p>41:21</p><p>yes so that i agree i call that also i</p><p>41:24</p><p>call that intuition</p><p>41:26</p><p>that's body information that we're not</p><p>41:28</p><p>conscious of</p><p>41:30</p><p>yeah okay um that's body body so that's</p><p>41:34</p><p>you know that's brain and</p><p>41:37</p><p>sometimes other things but it's usually</p><p>41:39</p><p>like just that's</p><p>41:40</p><p>stuff coming from our unconscious in our</p><p>41:44</p><p>brain</p><p>41:45</p><p>in ways that we're not conscious of so</p><p>41:47</p><p>that's really useful</p><p>41:48</p><p>that's like a body related thing and</p><p>41:50</p><p>then there's the soul related thing</p><p>41:52</p><p>we just know like um do you just know</p><p>41:56</p><p>that</p><p>41:58</p><p>do you just know that your connection</p><p>42:01</p><p>with spirit</p><p>42:04</p><p>just know it for no reason uh yeah</p><p>42:08</p><p>i i i just i i</p><p>42:11</p><p>question it but i know it sometimes</p><p>42:14</p><p>right</p><p>42:14</p><p>so you question it you intellectually</p><p>42:16</p><p>question it but you know it</p><p>42:17</p><p>yes right awesome great yeah that's yeah</p><p>42:21</p><p>good for you me too</p><p>42:25</p><p>um and then you know you cut</p><p>42:28</p><p>you came to several of my workshops</p><p>42:32</p><p>and i watched you like in you</p><p>42:34</p><p>consciously just</p><p>42:36</p><p>just you just go along you're just like</p><p>42:38</p><p>all right i'll go along with this crazy</p><p>42:39</p><p>stuff</p><p>42:40</p><p>you know all right like you just go</p><p>42:42</p><p>along i'm very compliant</p><p>42:46</p><p>but like and then you come back i'm just</p><p>42:48</p><p>like he's back</p><p>42:50</p><p>going along with this crazy stuff but</p><p>42:52</p><p>you ca you came several times and i'm</p><p>42:54</p><p>just like</p><p>42:55</p><p>he's not getting it consciously but he's</p><p>42:58</p><p>coming</p><p>42:59</p><p>why why</p><p>43:04</p><p>i don't know no idea why</p><p>43:08</p><p>right maybe knowing knowing there's</p><p>43:10</p><p>something</p><p>43:13</p><p>sensing uh something i guess and not</p><p>43:16</p><p>not necessarily with my mind but just</p><p>43:21</p><p>a sense yeah so maybe sensing</p><p>43:24</p><p>with your body or maybe you know body</p><p>43:26</p><p>senses i would say maybe knowing with</p><p>43:28</p><p>your</p><p>43:28</p><p>you know knowing this that there's</p><p>43:30</p><p>something going on here</p><p>43:32</p><p>i know i'm not seeing it but there's</p><p>43:34</p><p>something weird here that might be</p><p>43:35</p><p>useful</p><p>43:36</p><p>maybe um or something or maybe this is</p><p>43:39</p><p>knowing this</p><p>43:40</p><p>my way is here somewhere so anyway this</p><p>43:43</p><p>is knowingness that we're talking about</p><p>43:45</p><p>okay and uh i'm talking about the crown</p><p>43:48</p><p>chakra it um</p><p>43:50</p><p>it's its thing is knowing this clear</p><p>43:52</p><p>cognizance and</p><p>43:54</p><p>so we know how to connect to spirit we</p><p>43:57</p><p>know how to come</p><p>43:58</p><p>into the body and sit in the center of</p><p>44:01</p><p>the head</p><p>44:02</p><p>we know um we can connect to the akashic</p><p>44:04</p><p>records</p><p>44:06</p><p>which is like the um it's the uh</p><p>44:10</p><p>library of congress of seoul</p><p>44:13</p><p>all right right so you don't need to</p><p>44:16</p><p>know</p><p>44:16</p><p>everything here because who has space</p><p>44:19</p><p>for that</p><p>44:20</p><p>but we have library cards you know just</p><p>44:22</p><p>like what do i need to know now</p><p>44:24</p><p>um so anyway that's why like i would</p><p>44:28</p><p>like</p><p>44:28</p><p>i was looking it's like the two things</p><p>44:30</p><p>that i would you know that you might</p><p>44:32</p><p>consider</p><p>44:33</p><p>continuing to even though it means</p><p>44:35</p><p>nothing</p><p>44:37</p><p>break sticks and allow oh there is a</p><p>44:40</p><p>radio and i can turn it up to here</p><p>44:43</p><p>oh there is a um uh</p><p>44:46</p><p>what's it called which windshield around</p><p>44:48</p><p>here</p><p>44:49</p><p>i can i can let it be here it it</p><p>44:53</p><p>obviously it's not happening like that</p><p>44:54</p><p>but it can happen if you</p><p>44:56</p><p>keep asking for it does that make sense</p><p>44:58</p><p>ask and receive</p><p>44:59</p><p>yeah yeah it makes sense i've tried to</p><p>45:02</p><p>meditate</p><p>45:04</p><p>and i can't get into any kind of</p><p>45:08</p><p>every i always have the intruding</p><p>45:10</p><p>thoughts and i don't know</p><p>45:12</p><p>how to stop them right intruding</p><p>45:15</p><p>thoughts are normal</p><p>45:17</p><p>yeah i'm sure they are</p><p>45:20</p><p>and and uh they're they're intellectual</p><p>45:24</p><p>and they're</p><p>45:24</p><p>the stories that we live in upper throat</p><p>45:26</p><p>chakra stories to live in the stories</p><p>45:28</p><p>live in are always going</p><p>45:30</p><p>wow it actually helps create a reality</p><p>45:33</p><p>you know</p><p>45:33</p><p>a lot falls away when this falls away</p><p>45:37</p><p>um so uh</p><p>45:41</p><p>this the all the tools that you've done</p><p>45:43</p><p>with me all the things that we're doing</p><p>45:44</p><p>here this is active meditation</p><p>45:46</p><p>which for somebody like you might be a</p><p>45:48</p><p>good entree</p><p>45:50</p><p>because it's active it's more male it's</p><p>45:53</p><p>not just</p><p>45:53</p><p>sit down shut up because that doesn't</p><p>45:57</p><p>work</p><p>45:58</p><p>um eventually you keep practice if you</p><p>46:02</p><p>practice the active meditation</p><p>46:03</p><p>eventually</p><p>46:04</p><p>the the sit down shut up will work but</p><p>46:08</p><p>first of all you don't have access to</p><p>46:10</p><p>your feminine receptivity</p><p>46:13</p><p>you don't have access to it so it's just</p><p>46:15</p><p>like it doesn't work</p><p>46:17</p><p>i mean it can't work it's like the hot</p><p>46:19</p><p>water isn't connected so it can't flow</p><p>46:21</p><p>out the</p><p>46:22</p><p>pipe um so</p><p>46:25</p><p>you know we can work that you know you</p><p>46:27</p><p>can just ask for that to reconnect to</p><p>46:29</p><p>the feminine</p><p>46:34</p><p>and the other thing is that you have</p><p>46:36</p><p>pain and you have</p><p>46:37</p><p>fear and you have my experience you can</p><p>46:41</p><p>have your own experience</p><p>46:42</p><p>my experience is that you have fear and</p><p>46:44</p><p>pain and hate</p><p>46:45</p><p>and anger and [ __ ] a lot of</p><p>46:49</p><p>[ __ ] you know like who who can possibly</p><p>46:53</p><p>sit in that without</p><p>46:54</p><p>wanting to we can't sit in that</p><p>46:58</p><p>no so that's another thing about it</p><p>47:01</p><p>that's all there including depression</p><p>47:02</p><p>and anxiety</p><p>47:04</p><p>yeah yeah um which is being in the past</p><p>47:08</p><p>and being in the future</p><p>47:12</p><p>anything but here so</p><p>47:15</p><p>yeah so the idea is we utilize this</p><p>47:18</p><p>active meditation to say</p><p>47:20</p><p>oh let me break sticks or let roses come</p><p>47:22</p><p>and go let me break sticks for this</p><p>47:24</p><p>pain for this fear let it one stand at a</p><p>47:27</p><p>time drip out of my grounding</p><p>47:29</p><p>let one amount just disappear as i</p><p>47:32</p><p>explode a rose</p><p>47:33</p><p>um that's what this system is and i will</p><p>47:36</p><p>tell you</p><p>47:38</p><p>that um it took me a year</p><p>47:41</p><p>of doing creating because i came to this</p><p>47:43</p><p>system</p><p>47:44</p><p>i was bedridden i was</p><p>47:48</p><p>house bound i was bedridden a lot has</p><p>47:51</p><p>been for years</p><p>47:52</p><p>and um very very very ill and very very</p><p>47:55</p><p>you know psychically</p><p>47:56</p><p>in pain emotionally you know pain</p><p>47:58</p><p>relationally in pain</p><p>48:00</p><p>couldn't work obviously it was really</p><p>48:02</p><p>really really mess</p><p>48:03</p><p>and it took the first year i i couldn't</p><p>48:06</p><p>sit with</p><p>48:07</p><p>it you know i can't i couldn't just sit</p><p>48:09</p><p>with it but i could walk around the</p><p>48:10</p><p>block or i could watch a movie</p><p>48:12</p><p>or i could meditate with other people</p><p>48:15</p><p>and do some of these tools</p><p>48:17</p><p>i could do them while i walked around</p><p>48:19</p><p>the block because it was too intense to</p><p>48:21</p><p>sit in it</p><p>48:21</p><p>or i could do it well i swear i'd like</p><p>48:23</p><p>watch shows i'd watch like a funny show</p><p>48:26</p><p>and just do the tools</p><p>48:28</p><p>and i just let a rose come for pain come</p><p>48:30</p><p>and go come and go you can also break</p><p>48:32</p><p>sticks but i'd like a rose like i made a</p><p>48:34</p><p>i made a color i made like this</p><p>48:36</p><p>off-white color this</p><p>48:37</p><p>gray gray white color for pain</p><p>48:40</p><p>because that was my biggest issue pain</p><p>48:43</p><p>and i just let it come and go</p><p>48:44</p><p>all day long expl</p><p>48:47</p><p>and after about a year i was able to</p><p>48:50</p><p>start to</p><p>48:52</p><p>get closer to my body and closer to</p><p>48:54</p><p>starting to meditate on my own</p><p>48:57</p><p>um it was really intense um but it could</p><p>49:00</p><p>i could do it and i've come so far since</p><p>49:02</p><p>then it's been a while</p><p>49:04</p><p>so um</p><p>49:08</p><p>the the more eastern practices that we</p><p>49:11</p><p>know about</p><p>49:11</p><p>like uh zen or whatever they're for</p><p>49:15</p><p>people who</p><p>49:16</p><p>are in a different consciousness than</p><p>49:18</p><p>than</p><p>49:19</p><p>you are than i was then the people in</p><p>49:22</p><p>that consciousness would be just</p><p>49:24</p><p>peasants out working</p><p>49:28</p><p>um where with the kind of</p><p>49:32</p><p>intensity that you're in is really hard</p><p>49:35</p><p>to be with and that's</p><p>49:36</p><p>um so these tools are made in some ways</p><p>49:40</p><p>are made for that</p><p>49:41</p><p>to be able to dig out</p><p>49:44</p><p>so that you can be with your system does</p><p>49:46</p><p>that make sense</p><p>49:48</p><p>yeah yeah i guess</p><p>49:53</p><p>is this also being able to use to heal</p><p>49:56</p><p>the inner child yeah</p><p>49:59</p><p>um i have it it all does but i do have</p><p>50:02</p><p>specific ways to help with that yes</p><p>50:05</p><p>um that um we can't do today i mean i</p><p>50:08</p><p>can tell you what they are</p><p>50:10</p><p>some ways i've developed to do that but</p><p>50:12</p><p>um</p><p>50:14</p><p>let me see the thing is that</p><p>50:17</p><p>honestly it's very hard for you to just</p><p>50:19</p><p>to stay</p><p>50:20</p><p>here here now with</p><p>50:23</p><p>yourself and that's the first step of</p><p>50:26</p><p>caring for the inner child</p><p>50:30</p><p>sustaining here now with</p><p>50:34</p><p>okay you know being here now with with</p><p>50:38</p><p>your body</p><p>50:39</p><p>with your present in the present moment</p><p>50:43</p><p>i've been working on stuff like trying</p><p>50:45</p><p>to think about stuff like that</p><p>50:51</p><p>thinking about it is a good first step</p><p>50:57</p><p>honey i know i didn't get you to</p><p>50:58</p><p>birthday present but i did think about</p><p>51:00</p><p>it</p><p>51:00</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>51:05</p><p>anniversary and christmas whatever</p><p>51:09</p><p>right i thought about it</p><p>51:12</p><p>right and so like anyway yeah</p><p>51:15</p><p>yeah so anyway yeah</p><p>51:18</p><p>right and so thinking about it is</p><p>51:21</p><p>different than doing it</p><p>51:22</p><p>and doing it is that's what these tools</p><p>51:24</p><p>help us because these tools</p><p>51:25</p><p>help us to they're metaphors they're</p><p>51:28</p><p>just metaphors</p><p>51:30</p><p>but they're metaphors that help us</p><p>51:32</p><p>leverage into</p><p>51:33</p><p>underneath our everyday consciousness</p><p>51:36</p><p>would it be</p><p>51:37</p><p>advantageous to actually get some sticks</p><p>51:39</p><p>and break them</p><p>51:41</p><p>physically break them</p><p>51:45</p><p>you know that there's a lot of um</p><p>51:47</p><p>spiritual practices neopaganism uh for</p><p>51:50</p><p>example</p><p>51:50</p><p>that does stuff like that right they</p><p>51:52</p><p>sweep the floor</p><p>51:54</p><p>and say i'm sweeping out everything</p><p>51:56</p><p>negative</p><p>51:57</p><p>and they um use a</p><p>52:00</p><p>salt for you know to clear and say i'm</p><p>52:03</p><p>clearing or you</p><p>52:04</p><p>sage and say i'm clear right it's like</p><p>52:07</p><p>and that</p><p>52:07</p><p>it makes it real for the body yeah</p><p>52:11</p><p>but it doesn't mean that helps but it</p><p>52:13</p><p>doesn't have it</p><p>52:14</p><p>because it makes it real for the body it</p><p>52:16</p><p>makes it it might help you make it</p><p>52:18</p><p>easier for the soul</p><p>52:20</p><p>but it's all the soul that matters okay</p><p>52:24</p><p>so doing it just doing it in your</p><p>52:28</p><p>intention</p><p>52:29</p><p>i i know you can't see it so you're what</p><p>52:31</p><p>you're doing is you're doing it with</p><p>52:32</p><p>your hands</p><p>52:34</p><p>and you're intending you're knowing that</p><p>52:36</p><p>you're doing it</p><p>52:38</p><p>that's the important part just doing</p><p>52:39</p><p>this with your hands means nothing</p><p>52:41</p><p>okay so you've got it with the intention</p><p>52:43</p><p>no i know</p><p>52:44</p><p>that i am breaking the old bounds i know</p><p>52:47</p><p>i'm allowing this i know i'm letting go</p><p>52:49</p><p>of that</p><p>52:50</p><p>but that should be specific</p><p>52:53</p><p>things like i know i'm i'm breaking that</p><p>52:57</p><p>thought pattern or this you can do it in</p><p>53:00</p><p>general</p><p>53:01</p><p>but it still needs to be intentional</p><p>53:04</p><p>like just doing this</p><p>53:04</p><p>matters not but if you do this with the</p><p>53:06</p><p>intention</p><p>53:08</p><p>in my soul whatever needs breaking next</p><p>53:10</p><p>is breaking i</p><p>53:11</p><p>am breaking loose of the bounds that</p><p>53:14</p><p>have held me</p><p>53:15</p><p>and i'm breaking into a new</p><p>53:18</p><p>consciousness</p><p>53:19</p><p>okay okay i get that whatever general or</p><p>53:22</p><p>specific</p><p>53:23</p><p>mm-hmm okay um</p><p>53:26</p><p>there's been bounds on your on your</p><p>53:28</p><p>ankles and on your</p><p>53:30</p><p>ankles and uh wrists yeah no</p><p>53:33</p><p>you can know i'm breaking those bounds</p><p>53:36</p><p>and you know the feminine</p><p>53:38</p><p>i you know i mentioned i don't know if</p><p>53:40</p><p>it's it's it's it's uh</p><p>53:42</p><p>explicated in your life like this your</p><p>53:44</p><p>mom</p><p>53:45</p><p>your wife whatever it doesn't matter</p><p>53:48</p><p>sometimes it's very overt like that and</p><p>53:50</p><p>sometimes it's not but the feminine</p><p>53:52</p><p>element the feminine control</p><p>53:56</p><p>the feminine element that wants to</p><p>53:57</p><p>control the male</p><p>54:02</p><p>has has had you yeah</p><p>54:06</p><p>i believe that is so</p><p>54:10</p><p>important i'm breaking i'm breaking i i</p><p>54:14</p><p>it's so it's so i mean it's kind of</p><p>54:16</p><p>fascinating to look at you like this</p><p>54:18</p><p>because you're just</p><p>54:19</p><p>you're just textbook for my theory</p><p>54:23</p><p>uh my i i i'm a you know i'm a scientist</p><p>54:26</p><p>at heart i'm a soul scientist</p><p>54:28</p><p>and so i've had this theory and you are</p><p>54:30</p><p>just textbook as i look at you</p><p>54:32</p><p>about being stuck in the mail</p><p>54:35</p><p>uh here you have to act like this</p><p>54:39</p><p>you can't have that and we want to</p><p>54:42</p><p>control you</p><p>54:44</p><p>um and then if</p><p>54:47</p><p>you try to break out</p><p>54:50</p><p>you're bad yeah</p><p>54:53</p><p>you're well you're angry you're bad it's</p><p>54:56</p><p>like who wouldn't be angry</p><p>54:58</p><p>just who wouldn't be angry you're very</p><p>55:00</p><p>and i came into this being like we have</p><p>55:02</p><p>to work with anger</p><p>55:04</p><p>so we'll get to that um because anger is</p><p>55:07</p><p>your best friend</p><p>55:10</p><p>was considered my worst enemy</p><p>55:15</p><p>i was i was talk taught that we</p><p>55:17</p><p>shouldn't</p><p>55:18</p><p>show anger i was just taught that that</p><p>55:22</p><p>it wasn't</p><p>55:22</p><p>it wasn't acceptable yes yes</p><p>55:27</p><p>exactly and that makes you</p><p>55:31</p><p>if somebody takes away your anger that</p><p>55:34</p><p>makes you controllable and it</p><p>55:37</p><p>sets you in the victim place</p><p>55:42</p><p>okay meanwhile it doesn't mean you</p><p>55:44</p><p>should be cracking heads</p><p>55:46</p><p>mind you</p><p>55:52</p><p>good um it's anger angers and energy</p><p>55:56</p><p>we can use here and</p><p>56:00</p><p>then um then we care for ourselves it's</p><p>56:03</p><p>another</p><p>56:04</p><p>hugely important part of</p><p>56:07</p><p>caring for the inner child because who</p><p>56:10</p><p>stood</p><p>56:12</p><p>for you john who stood for you</p><p>56:16</p><p>when you were little who stood for you</p><p>56:18</p><p>who protected you</p><p>56:19</p><p>who made sure you were taken care of who</p><p>56:22</p><p>made sure that you</p><p>56:23</p><p>you you got your needs met who just who</p><p>56:30</p><p>i have no idea if anybody really did</p><p>56:32</p><p>[Music]</p><p>56:36</p><p>you didn't get hurt who did that for you</p><p>56:41</p><p>you're going in and out and it's it's</p><p>56:43</p><p>like breaking probably not</p><p>56:45</p><p>and so now it's your job your job</p><p>56:49</p><p>to do it for you</p><p>56:53</p><p>let me see this

we</p><p>61:32</p><p>haven't been protected</p><p>61:33</p><p>and that makes a space for the healing</p><p>61:35</p><p>of the inner child</p><p>61:39</p><p>so there must be constructive ways</p><p>61:43</p><p>to uh express anger</p><p>61:46</p><p>without being like an erupting volcano</p><p>61:51</p><p>yeah and what happens is we don't own</p><p>61:53</p><p>the if we don't own the anger and we</p><p>61:54</p><p>don't</p><p>61:55</p><p>um handle things ahead of time because</p><p>61:58</p><p>we're not allowed</p><p>61:59</p><p>then then every now and then we explode</p><p>62:02</p><p>yeah and that's what we don't want</p><p>62:04</p><p>um so yeah i'll show you and how how to</p><p>62:06</p><p>do the energy and it might not be</p><p>62:08</p><p>real for

metaphorically</p><p>75:06</p><p>come from behind you</p><p>75:08</p><p>little sparks of light of your own</p><p>75:10</p><p>attention into the center of your house</p><p>75:12</p><p>head coming out of uh the past and when</p><p>75:15</p><p>i have too much of my energy in the past</p><p>75:17</p><p>i'm depressed because</p><p>75:18</p><p>i'm taking all my energy</p><p>75:21</p><p>back there

center</p><p>75:29</p><p>of your head lit let the iron filings of</p><p>75:32</p><p>your</p><p>75:32</p><p>attention in the past come back gently</p><p>75:34</p><p>to the center of your head</p><p>75:37</p><p>as the anger flows good and now</p><p>75:43</p><p>little pieces of of metal</p><p>75:46</p><p>coming from the future</p><p>75:51</p><p>out of the future back to

the body because we're</p><p>76:02</p><p>way out into the future the body</p><p>76:04</p><p>can't access it can't help it can't</p><p>76:06</p><p>change it just like the past</p><p>76:08</p><p>can't

allow change in identity and</p><p>77:50</p><p>that's dying daily that's dying to who</p><p>77:52</p><p>we think we are and what we</p><p>77:54</p><p>what we think we're supposed to be and</p><p>77:56</p><p>how we think we're supposed to be and</p><p>77:58</p><p>what we think god wants us and what we</p><p>78:00</p><p>think everybody else wants us or</p><p>78:02</p><p>whatever</p><p>78:03</p><p>we believe uh the past and we break</p><p>78:07</p><p>into a new reality of more freedom</p><p>78:12</p><p>there you go i can</p><p>78:15</p><p>i can do this good center of head</p><p>78:24</p><p>grounding</p><p>78:26</p><p>so two questions</p><p>78:29</p><p>i don't know if you've noticed anything</p><p>78:31</p><p>but if you do let me know</p><p>78:33</p><p>but more importantly that you understand</p><p>78:36</p><p>the</p><p>78:37</p><p>intention because you're doing it and</p><p>78:40</p><p>um red dragon is in front of you</p><p>78:42</p><p>inspiring you</p><p>78:43</p><p>jesus is behind you inspiring you what</p><p>78:46</p><p>do you notice is going on what are you</p><p>78:48</p><p>what are your what are your questions</p><p>78:51</p><p>i just</p><p>78:54</p><p>i like the fact that i don't have to</p><p>78:56</p><p>feel things but i can</p><p>78:58</p><p>actually just tell myself that that's</p><p>79:01</p><p>what's going on</p><p>79:02</p><p>that that the fountain's coming out of</p><p>79:04</p><p>my head or red dragons in front of me</p><p>79:07</p><p>and</p><p>79:07</p><p>jesus is behind me and that it's okay to</p><p>79:12</p><p>it's okay to be angry</p><p>79:16</p><p>there's just uh it's okay to be who i am</p><p>79:20</p><p>and find out who i am yeah</p><p>79:23</p><p>amen amen</p><p>79:27</p><p>so in doing this did you notice any</p><p>79:31</p><p>of your usual feelings of anger</p><p>79:39</p><p>i can't say that i did maybe a few</p><p>79:41</p><p>fleeting</p><p>79:42</p><p>that just came in and out just</p><p>79:45</p><p>remembering times when i got angry yeah</p><p>79:49</p><p>why great um that will happen because</p><p>79:52</p><p>you're clearing the old</p><p>79:54</p><p>anger um and that's part of it like i</p><p>79:57</p><p>was saying</p><p>79:58</p><p>fear and i was saying shame and i was</p><p>80:00</p><p>saying</p><p>80:02</p><p>oh what's that thing um pain but also</p><p>80:05</p><p>clearing the old anger is very helpful</p><p>80:07</p><p>you have tons of it</p><p>80:08</p><p>you have tons of old anger um</p><p>80:11</p><p>because you haven't known what to do</p><p>80:13</p><p>with it you're just told not to have it</p><p>80:15</p><p>but you do have it</p><p>80:19</p><p>it's crazy making and it's so it stopped</p><p>80:22</p><p>everything up</p><p>80:24</p><p>so um so just letting this anger flow</p><p>80:28</p><p>uh it's warm like warmer mountain ice</p><p>80:30</p><p>and i know you're not seeing the colors</p><p>80:32</p><p>yet but just</p><p>80:33</p><p>just fyi i tend to see old anger is like</p><p>80:36</p><p>blood dried blood red kind of color</p><p>80:40</p><p>um whereas the fresh anger is fire</p><p>80:42</p><p>engine you know it's just</p><p>80:43</p><p>fresh anger uh red</p><p>80:47</p><p>um and so just know that there's two</p><p>80:50</p><p>flavors that old stuff is just useless</p><p>80:53</p><p>because</p><p>80:53</p><p>the poo the purpose of all of</p><p>80:57</p><p>our feelings is to communicate from the</p><p>80:59</p><p>body to</p><p>81:00</p><p>us in the moment in the very moment</p><p>81:04</p><p>any of the old stuff is just</p><p>81:08</p><p>packed away in the way it doesn't help</p><p>81:11</p><p>us</p><p>81:12</p><p>doesn't help us because when the anger</p><p>81:14</p><p>flares</p><p>81:15</p><p>that's when we know oh that</p><p>81:19</p><p>get off my foot you're on my toe get off</p><p>81:22</p><p>my toe</p><p>81:23</p><p>right in the very moment and we don't</p><p>81:25</p><p>have to say it like that we could say</p><p>81:28</p><p>oh i'm taking care of myself oh i'm</p><p>81:30</p><p>angry okay let me</p><p>81:31</p><p>let anger flow i'm taking care of me</p><p>81:33</p><p>body what's happening</p><p>81:35</p><p>they don't even realize they're on my</p><p>81:36</p><p>toe oh would you kindly</p><p>81:39</p><p>you know get your high shoe off of my</p><p>81:42</p><p>toe oh that's so great thank you</p><p>81:44</p><p>we don't have to when we own our anger</p><p>81:48</p><p>we're taking care of ourselves and we</p><p>81:49</p><p>don't have to go</p><p>81:51</p><p>we can then choose to</p><p>81:56</p><p>um be sweet as sweet as pie</p><p>81:59</p><p>or you know direct and assertive or</p><p>82:03</p><p>there's times off of my foot</p><p>82:06</p><p>is the appropriate response but not as a</p><p>82:09</p><p>reaction as an action</p><p>82:11</p><p>okay does that make sense yeah yeah</p><p>82:15</p><p>so so if the idea is first we oh</p><p>82:19</p><p>whether you know in real life when i'm</p><p>82:22</p><p>angry</p><p>82:24</p><p>like i'm feeling it i have those</p><p>82:25</p><p>chemicals the body makes the chemicals</p><p>82:28</p><p>and i'm like you know</p><p>82:32</p><p>but like you know i'm socialized</p><p>82:35</p><p>similarly to you like i don't have a lot</p><p>82:37</p><p>of um</p><p>82:39</p><p>i wasn't socialized to have any room for</p><p>82:41</p><p>that um</p><p>82:42</p><p>so i let the anger flow in me and i</p><p>82:45</p><p>really i use the</p><p>82:47</p><p>the picture if this helps you i use the</p><p>82:50</p><p>picture of the rocket</p><p>82:51</p><p>but the rocket that i use for anger</p><p>82:53</p><p>picture is that i'm still in cape</p><p>82:54</p><p>canaveral</p><p>82:56</p><p>and i'm still hooked down but the fire</p><p>82:59</p><p>is coming out</p><p>83:00</p><p>okay and but i'm still i'm hooked down</p><p>83:03</p><p>and i the fire goes all the way to the</p><p>83:04</p><p>center of the earth and it helps me stay</p><p>83:06</p><p>grounded and when i stay</p><p>83:09</p><p>grounded conscious of my connection to</p><p>83:13</p><p>the earth</p><p>83:14</p><p>and let the anger run then i stay in</p><p>83:17</p><p>control of myself even when i'm insanely</p><p>83:20</p><p>angry</p><p>83:22</p><p>and then like to rage and i say hi to</p><p>83:26</p><p>the red dragon</p><p>83:27</p><p>and i rage and i do it here</p><p>83:31</p><p>and then on the outside of me i can</p><p>83:33</p><p>choose and i can say i ran a psychic</p><p>83:35</p><p>school i helped run a psychic school i</p><p>83:37</p><p>was a co-director for</p><p>83:39</p><p>almost five years and i'd have these</p><p>83:41</p><p>management meetings with a bunch of</p><p>83:43</p><p>psychic teachers</p><p>83:44</p><p>and it was like you know i just wanted</p><p>83:46</p><p>to shoot them on the head</p><p>83:48</p><p>you know it was like incessant [ __ ]</p><p>83:50</p><p>right it was just incessant</p><p>83:52</p><p>and they're all psychics and i'm running</p><p>83:55</p><p>anger</p><p>83:56</p><p>so many times so many of the meetings</p><p>83:57</p><p>i'm just running anger like it's saving</p><p>83:59</p><p>my life</p><p>84:00</p><p>right and sitting there and they don't</p><p>84:03</p><p>even know</p><p>84:03</p><p>i'm angry because it's all here</p><p>84:08</p><p>and then outside i can say what can we</p><p>84:11</p><p>do about this</p><p>84:12</p><p>how can you handle that how can we have</p><p>84:15</p><p>you be on time</p><p>84:16</p><p>how can we write like</p><p>84:21</p><p>yeah but but it wouldn't have helped me</p><p>84:23</p><p>to be</p><p>84:25</p><p>raging on the outside it doesn't help</p><p>84:28</p><p>but so instead i took care of myself</p><p>84:30</p><p>i let the anger hold me to here now</p><p>84:33</p><p>so i didn't go flying out with a bunch</p><p>84:35</p><p>of f's coming out of my face</p><p>84:38</p><p>and then i could act but it gave me</p><p>84:41</p><p>enough push to be just like we need to</p><p>84:44</p><p>fix this problem</p><p>84:47</p><p>instead of just being like a victim and</p><p>84:48</p><p>being like oh whatever i can't</p><p>84:50</p><p>i can't make any difference</p><p>84:56</p><p>does it make any sense yeah</p><p>85:00</p><p>so it's all practice it doesn't you know</p><p>85:02</p><p>when we start it doesn't</p><p>85:04</p><p>uh make any difference but maybe if you</p><p>85:06</p><p>said hello to this as a practice</p><p>85:08</p><p>grounded centered run anger with jesus</p><p>85:11</p><p>and red dragon</p><p>85:13</p><p>even five minutes um</p><p>85:17</p><p>and then hopefully longer what we did</p><p>85:20</p><p>today</p><p>85:20</p><p>did move out a bunch of stuff you you're</p><p>85:22</p><p>just packed</p><p>85:24</p><p>packed and packed and packed with so</p><p>85:26</p><p>many</p><p>85:27</p><p>emotions old emotions</p><p>85:30</p><p>and i'll just say it's like emotions are</p><p>85:32</p><p>like telegrams we need them in the</p><p>85:34</p><p>moment oh</p><p>85:35</p><p>just had a baby ooh you know in the old</p><p>85:36</p><p>days they had telegrams</p><p>85:38</p><p>and so we get all these telegrams but if</p><p>85:39</p><p>we won't read them they just stack up on</p><p>85:41</p><p>the desk</p><p>85:43</p><p>and then like they were like oh my god</p><p>85:46</p><p>i can't handle this the desk is just</p><p>85:48</p><p>full of telegrams and when new ones come</p><p>85:50</p><p>we can't even see or hear them we don't</p><p>85:51</p><p>know they're there</p><p>85:53</p><p>yeah stop being able to feel</p><p>85:57</p><p>but things just get worse and so the</p><p>86:00</p><p>idea here was the anger is we're just</p><p>86:01</p><p>like throwing them all in the fire</p><p>86:03</p><p>we're just taking telegrams and throwing</p><p>86:05</p><p>them in the in the</p><p>86:06</p><p>in the burning um what's the word trash</p><p>86:09</p><p>can</p><p>86:11</p><p>throwing telegrams in the print trash</p><p>86:13</p><p>can and then we get a clean desk</p><p>86:16</p><p>and then when new telegrams come we can</p><p>86:19</p><p>notice them and say</p><p>86:20</p><p>oh i'm really not happy about this</p><p>86:24</p><p>i need you to get off my foot oh i'm so</p><p>86:27</p><p>sad i</p><p>86:27</p><p>i'm dealing with this loss okay body</p><p>86:31</p><p>okay</p><p>86:31</p><p>lunar child let's take a few minutes and</p><p>86:34</p><p>just</p><p>86:35</p><p>i'll be with you we can we can</p><p>86:38</p><p>appropriately start</p><p>86:39</p><p>and takes a minute but we can probably</p><p>86:41</p><p>start to take care of our body</p><p>86:44</p><p>and the emotions that are happening</p><p>86:50</p><p>okay okay</p><p>86:53</p><p>so that's more than enough for today um</p><p>87:04</p><p>so you got a bunch of i'll send you the</p><p>87:05</p><p>there's probably more than

id="JohnKempWRW-Male/FemaleEnergy&amp;Anger-ConversationTranscript-WithoutTimestamps:">Without Timestamps:</h2><p>we are getting together</p><p>because you've been struggling through</p><p>heaviness</p><p>uh yeah i've been i've been struggling</p><p>quite a bit</p><p>um for for a long time but just recently</p><p>uh in particular i've been</p><p>i've been noticing i'm just very</p><p>agitated</p><p>and angry and not really very social or</p><p>easy to get along with</p><p>and um do you i just</p><p>i just want to check um you know we're</p><p>going to do</p><p>work in the soul um i just want to check</p><p>you're staying on top of all your</p><p>medical stuff</p><p>yes actually i just went to um</p><p>the doctor a couple days ago and i'm</p><p>going to have a</p><p>a neuro test and my uh the neurologist</p><p>said that</p><p>she thinks i have pseudo-depression</p><p>caused by lack of sleep so i</p><p>adjusted when i'm taking my medications</p><p>to the point where i'm actually taking</p><p>the ones at night that i'm supposed to</p><p>be taking at night</p><p>instead of everything during the day and</p><p>i think that's helped a little</p><p>and also my wife wanted me to try to</p><p>get my cpap back out and see if that</p><p>helps</p><p>and i've worn that a couple of nights</p><p>and i really don't like it so</p><p>um i'm going to try it again though</p><p>so you're only of course no you know it</p><p>sucks</p><p>um but does it help you sleep better or</p><p>does it keep you from sleeping</p><p>uh last night it really kept me from</p><p>sleeping</p><p>yeah uh the night before which is the</p><p>first night i really tried it</p><p>i don't think it bothered me too much</p><p>but last night it was making like</p><p>a gurgling sound in the hose and that</p><p>just kept me awake</p><p>yeah so i just took it off okay so</p><p>you're gonna talk to your doctor about</p><p>that</p><p>yeah and i i probably have to get uh a</p><p>new sleep study done</p><p>and maybe they'll recommend a different</p><p>cpap i don't know</p><p>okay and do you mind if i do this</p><p>medical thing because something medical</p><p>is up and i just want to clear that</p><p>before we go to the soul is that all</p><p>right</p><p>sure sure absolutely all right so um</p><p>uh you've been getting your heart</p><p>checked how's your heart</p><p>oh yeah it's fine i've been to my doctor</p><p>all my</p><p>uh numbers are good good enough you know</p><p>right in</p><p>in line except for i went and just had a</p><p>a a blood test because this</p><p>doctor said my b12 was low and it was</p><p>it was really low so i'm going to start</p><p>taking some supplements</p><p>for that and i might even get some</p><p>injections but my wife and i are</p><p>kind of haggling over what would be the</p><p>proper course because my doctor's office</p><p>i uh where i could get them through</p><p>there but it cost me over</p><p>a thousand dollars for four injections</p><p>no</p><p>yeah i know and and i went to a vitamin</p><p>store in the mall of where i go walking</p><p>and they can give me four injections for</p><p>um like 90 bucks or 75 bucks</p><p>and so i i want i i lean that way but</p><p>my wife is real skeptical because she</p><p>says they got skin in the game and</p><p>they're</p><p>trying to make a profit and i'm like the</p><p>doctor right</p><p>yeah exactly i i just i'm i'm not a fan</p><p>at all a big pharma</p><p>not at all right um</p><p>could i say something about the b12 sure</p><p>like if the doctor thinks um some</p><p>injections are good</p><p>great and uh i don't know maybe do a</p><p>little more research but</p><p>i don't see why it would be different</p><p>but whatever that's not you know</p><p>whatever</p><p>but saving nine hundred dollars</p><p>you can do a lot with 900 yeah</p><p>right um meanwhile uh</p><p>my naturopath recommended for me a</p><p>sublingual b12</p><p>um she told me that it gets in you know</p><p>because regular b12 has trouble getting</p><p>getting in um so if you want</p><p>um ping me after and i'll send you the</p><p>information what i mean it's not</p><p>expensive</p><p>um and at least you know you can take</p><p>that daily and even if only a little</p><p>gets in it helps</p><p>right uh my my wife we get</p><p>uh a shipment monthly i think from hap</p><p>our insurance and it's free so</p><p>we ordered some supplements um</p><p>some slow release b12 that you put on</p><p>your tongue</p><p>and it dissolves great and and they're</p><p>five</p><p>five thousand micrograms which may be</p><p>too much</p><p>but i guess b12 just if</p><p>if it doesn't get absorbed it just goes</p><p>out of the body anyway so</p><p>yeah great okay good um and</p><p>uh i'm just the thing that</p><p>there's just something bother you you</p><p>don't have like a pacemaker or anything</p><p>like that right</p><p>no there's something i don't know it</p><p>just won't go away</p><p>it's like to the side of the heart and</p><p>it's like</p><p>i have got electrical feel or maybe</p><p>nerves or something is there any reason</p><p>why</p><p>i would have a hit on anything like that</p><p>uh i don't quite think i heard what you</p><p>said</p><p>i'm getting a hit i'm getting some kind</p><p>of impression</p><p>of uh um something it's like</p><p>electrical or nerve ish ner you know</p><p>electrical or nerve</p><p>to the side of your heart like to the</p><p>side</p><p>the left side i can't read it it's one</p><p>i'm not sure one one of the sides</p><p>is there anything um that would</p><p>be a reason for that that you can</p><p>imagine</p><p>not really okay</p><p>all right i'm just going to go on but if</p><p>i get a hit on anything else about it</p><p>i'll let you know</p><p>but there's something it's like i'm</p><p>getting uh um</p><p>it's related to</p><p>my aura it's something physical it's</p><p>like</p><p>it's related to you know um it's like</p><p>i'm not saying it is it's</p><p>like with the um sleep apnea</p><p>where uh like you</p><p>aren't getting what you need or</p><p>something's going right in the body and</p><p>then the body jolts itself</p><p>there's the jewel and that's f that</p><p>brings fear right it brings fear because</p><p>it brings adrenaline or whatever the</p><p>reason that's why you need a</p><p>cpap right because you have</p><p>trouble breathing and it wakes you up it</p><p>it doesn't just wake you up it startles</p><p>you awake</p><p>um i haven't felt that in a long time</p><p>anything like that because i used to do</p><p>that when i was sleeping i</p><p>get startled awake but uh</p><p>i guess there maybe has been a couple</p><p>times</p><p>um right recently what i'm thinking</p><p>i couldn't think that</p><p>that that's actually true but but um</p><p>but you've experienced it before in the</p><p>past</p><p>i have but a lot of times it was just</p><p>because of reflux</p><p>yeah right okay that does the same thing</p><p>reflects kind of like startles you awake</p><p>right it's like</p><p>you're sleeping and then whoa i'm awake</p><p>that that startlement yeah what i'm</p><p>pointing to</p><p>it's i'm not talking about i'm not</p><p>talking about</p><p>reflex or sleep apnea i'm talking about</p><p>the startlingness</p><p>and how that weight like it's startling</p><p>and then you</p><p>it like it's fear fear-bringing</p><p>like it's like there's that fear</p><p>reaction that awake</p><p>when you were sleeping feeling does that</p><p>make sense that's what i'm pointing to</p><p>make sense i just i just don't know if</p><p>that's</p><p>actually what happens but i'll try to</p><p>um watch for it in it when i wake up at</p><p>night</p><p>no no no okay so just erase the</p><p>whiteboard</p><p>nothing i said maybe just erase it all</p><p>so all i'm saying is that</p><p>that experience of startlement</p><p>is there's something going on your</p><p>system saying</p><p>startle</p><p>and um it's bringing</p><p>fear of course it's bringing um</p><p>fear unsettlement vulnerability</p><p>uh can i interject something here yeah</p><p>please</p><p>um there has been a number of times</p><p>when i've been asleep and i heard</p><p>what i thought it sounded exactly like</p><p>my wife</p><p>yelling john wake up</p><p>and uh there's no one there</p><p>it's it's not her it's just i hear it</p><p>and i startled myself awake that way</p><p>that that has happened and i have woken</p><p>up kind of startled</p><p>the past couple of mornings kind of</p><p>startled</p><p>but not really but i'm looking at two</p><p>different walls</p><p>uh when i woke up one on each time</p><p>and there's writing on the wall and i</p><p>can't read it</p><p>but it's obviously it's there it's</p><p>writing</p><p>so i'm just i'm just i'm feeling like</p><p>what the</p><p>hell's going on what the [ __ ] is going</p><p>on</p><p>yeah yeah let's just be real</p><p>okay and now we're merging into the soul</p><p>experience</p><p>so we'll go there but it's affecting</p><p>your body</p><p>whatever is happening so i i would like</p><p>you to</p><p>i don't want to scare you in any way but</p><p>there's just something</p><p>that is affecting your body being</p><p>startled</p><p>we're going to go in the soul and which</p><p>obviously you've got stuff</p><p>you know yeah i mean from the future</p><p>experiences</p><p>um to get your attention</p><p>and um i i just i have a feel</p><p>it means certainly affecting your body</p><p>but um</p><p>i just just watch</p><p>watch for what i said that like</p><p>electrical thing if you get any kind of</p><p>hit about it do something</p><p>okay okay um i</p><p>i have had something like that before</p><p>but</p><p>and i'm getting it recently a kind of</p><p>like an</p><p>electric feeling a discharge in my jaw</p><p>and teeth</p><p>but it was the last time it was from</p><p>a medication i was taking and i'm not</p><p>taking it anymore</p><p>but i am taking like</p><p>10 or 11 different medications now so</p><p>it could still be something like that</p><p>causing</p><p>a medical problem yeah there's just um</p><p>it's like too much communication nerve</p><p>communication</p><p>or and or too much electrical charge</p><p>and or yeah so just just</p><p>nothing to be worried about but just if</p><p>you have anything that's like</p><p>oh wendy talked about this electrical</p><p>charge thing</p><p>now i know what she's talking about be</p><p>like oh now i know what she's talking</p><p>about is there's something to do about</p><p>it so that my body cannot be so</p><p>hyper vigilant so hyper</p><p>up you know because that leads to no</p><p>sleep it leads to</p><p>fear okay um which leads to anger</p><p>i just have to kill somebody now</p><p>there's definitely fight or flight going</p><p>on and you know that</p><p>um that's called the sympathetic nervous</p><p>system i don't know if you're familiar</p><p>that's the fight or flight or freeze</p><p>yeah right and that's where a lot of</p><p>people</p><p>spend their time in our society but we</p><p>belong in the opposite</p><p>the this parasympathetic where that's</p><p>uh rest and digest right and</p><p>so and so there's something about your</p><p>system cert will go to the soul and that</p><p>makes sense that there's stuff startling</p><p>you</p><p>but in the body they're startling in</p><p>that that's very</p><p>uncomfortable because it just doesn't</p><p>you you understand when you don't get</p><p>enough rest or sleep</p><p>it um it causes all kinds of hay</p><p>wiredness</p><p>yeah yeah okay great so i'll get out of</p><p>the body and unless it</p><p>um it comes back but uh so</p><p>um beautiful part is that you have some</p><p>tools you've done some workshops with me</p><p>and i am thrilled you know the other day</p><p>you said and it was so good for me</p><p>because you said</p><p>you know i don't talk much in groups</p><p>because in person you're much more</p><p>loquacious so thank you</p><p>that's not a problem i just i just fear</p><p>um not being able to say what i want to</p><p>say</p><p>right and people not understanding</p><p>because i know i have a tendency to</p><p>have to really think before i speak</p><p>yeah especially especially with my wife</p><p>i don't like to say anything to her</p><p>i hear you sometimes we get you know the</p><p>nerves</p><p>that we get on each other's soft parts</p><p>and then ow</p><p>okay so um so let's do a few tools which</p><p>is why i usually start but i just got</p><p>hit with your body stuff</p><p>um so let's let's notice that we're</p><p>actually here in our bodies and we're</p><p>actually connected to the earth</p><p>and we're releasing what we're done with</p><p>like sand in our hands to the earth</p><p>gorgeous you're good at this gorgeous</p><p>and just breathe let's breathe in from</p><p>the universe breathe fill your chest and</p><p>belly</p><p>and exhale down your grounding to the</p><p>center of the earth gorgeous</p><p>wow you're so energetically capable and</p><p>i just want to encourage you about this</p><p>just keep breathing</p><p>breathe in breathe your co-fill your</p><p>chest feel your belly</p><p>release that breath through the center</p><p>of the ear just keep doing that</p><p>i just want to validate for you um</p><p>one of the things is that's going on for</p><p>you is</p><p>spiritual you know we're all spirit</p><p>we're all</p><p>we're all there we're all jesus in</p><p>heavenly places it's already done we're</p><p>already loved</p><p>this second i was where i was i was</p><p>turning up the</p><p>volume okay so we're already we're</p><p>already spirit we're already there we're</p><p>already seated with</p><p>jesus in heavenly places we're already</p><p>uh light and love and truth</p><p>and then we're learning to bring heaven</p><p>to earth we're learning to</p><p>be light in the body um we're</p><p>learning to do what jesus did to be</p><p>divine presence</p><p>in flesh yep</p><p>and so you're in your soul journey like</p><p>everybody else</p><p>and um you've you've ratcheted</p><p>in your actual extra experience and your</p><p>actual soul</p><p>behavior very you know you're really</p><p>like fast and capable and there and</p><p>doing it</p><p>um and then your</p><p>consciousness though of that is</p><p>lagging behind very normal so</p><p>i'm sitting here and i'm watching you</p><p>and i'm saying all right</p><p>let's let's ground and let go to the</p><p>earth and you're doing i say let's just</p><p>make it more real both of breath</p><p>and you're doing it and in your</p><p>consciousness</p><p>let me just see where you are i don't</p><p>think you're as</p><p>as knowing hey you turned around you</p><p>turned again i did</p><p>i had to i had to pick up my phone let</p><p>me turn it again</p><p>i had to pick up my phone to turn the</p><p>volume up</p><p>and everything went haywire okay okay</p><p>that's perfect perfect we're on the same</p><p>page now so</p><p>it consciously when i say</p><p>be here now and connect to the earth</p><p>release to the earth what do you</p><p>notice in your in your subtle subtly</p><p>what do you notice in your soul</p><p>uh nothing i figured</p><p>right you're just like she babbles along</p><p>and then she tells me i'm doing great</p><p>i'm like that's nice wendy</p><p>i just i just don't know if i have any</p><p>perception in that area</p><p>yes so so what my perception of you</p><p>that's part of my job is to validate</p><p>what</p><p>you know because i can i can see maybe</p><p>what you can't right yet</p><p>because i work with a ton of people and</p><p>some of them are</p><p>you know just are not to the place where</p><p>they can do what you're doing</p><p>and but you are you're just in your</p><p>consciousness and you're</p><p>part of it you're you know you're so</p><p>body's identified and</p><p>that's normal it's normal but you're</p><p>making the turn in your soul</p><p>to become more conscious of what is</p><p>below your everyday consciousness</p><p>yeah yes so just</p><p>yes and so sure whatever whatever you</p><p>want to call it</p><p>so um so it makes sense to me that in</p><p>your dreams because</p><p>you know visions and dreams are</p><p>basically the same thing</p><p>okay um except for visions</p><p>we are conscious for</p><p>okay and dreams we are sleeping</p><p>here for but we get it on that</p><p>we get it in the astral or in the dream</p><p>time and um so</p><p>i see i'm just looking at you in the</p><p>astral and you're dancing and singing</p><p>you're so free</p><p>it's like i would say</p><p>it's interesting because you you know</p><p>you have a strong male</p><p>affect um</p><p>you mean you look like a man right</p><p>and you um you know you're a little bit</p><p>more</p><p>quiet like men are and you've got a nice</p><p>deep voice and you know you</p><p>you present as a man you're cisgendered</p><p>um and to do</p><p>that in our society especially america</p><p>it means taking</p><p>other parts of yourself and like</p><p>de-emphasizing</p><p>them okay does that make sense</p><p>the more yeah some of the emotional some</p><p>of the</p><p>com you know natural compassion whatever</p><p>some of the parts that</p><p>the more overt compassion i mean men are</p><p>great right men are awesome</p><p>and in our society men are trained to be</p><p>um shut up emotions shut up uh</p><p>fluffy things so yeah anyway</p><p>yeah yeah it's your life</p><p>it's um so what i see</p><p>funny funny is i look at you in the</p><p>astral and it's like</p><p>colors and um</p><p>skipping like like</p><p>bringing in more of the feminine energy</p><p>because masculine feminine you know two</p><p>two wings of the bird we're all we all</p><p>have the both</p><p>right right and and i would like to</p><p>astral there's a lot</p><p>of ownership of the feminine yeah i</p><p>would like to get</p><p>that because i at one time thought i</p><p>actually had</p><p>um mo well i had more of it when i was</p><p>young</p><p>and as i got older i just</p><p>stopped yes you know so</p><p>yeah i want to get back there yeah i</p><p>just want to get back society does this</p><p>to us</p><p>so that it's it's the socialization in</p><p>our society of men</p><p>uh women get it differently um so yes of</p><p>course</p><p>when you were young you had it you know</p><p>you had more um natural</p><p>uh like nurturance</p><p>and playfulness and like a desire</p><p>to access like beauty like the flouncy</p><p>colorful beauty yeah that's my read you</p><p>can</p><p>i mean it's your life but that's what</p><p>i'm noticing so anything that's one</p><p>thing</p><p>in in the astral you have been re-owning</p><p>your</p><p>uh feminine energy which is very healthy</p><p>uh all</p><p>healthy human beings have both no matter</p><p>what our gender identity is</p><p>so um so that's really cool and that</p><p>looks really nurturing and i see you</p><p>like in the astrals drinking in of pools</p><p>of of water which is you know a feminine</p><p>uh kind of image uh sometimes they</p><p>call water like emotions or the soul so</p><p>that looks really great i i don't</p><p>usually</p><p>read like this but this is just so</p><p>dominant in your astral experience</p><p>so um it's just a matter of your</p><p>allowing um and if you want from the</p><p>center of your head just</p><p>just because i say that and i'm doing it</p><p>you're just you're going to do it</p><p>center of head and just let um</p><p>i'd like to break sticks so you can do</p><p>that with your actual hands to make it</p><p>real for you</p><p>just like really really thin easy</p><p>um dry sticks</p><p>in your hands in your lap or whatever um</p><p>and also on your screen energetically</p><p>you can break them good</p><p>and we're breaking your old patterns of</p><p>um</p><p>pushing the feminine to the shadow</p><p>are you familiar with the idea of the</p><p>shadow the jungian idea that we</p><p>separate ourselves so i tend to read</p><p>that behind</p><p>us and so just with breaking the sticks</p><p>we're just saying i'm taking i'm just</p><p>wanting to take one little</p><p>speck of sand out of</p><p>my unconsciousness to my consciousness</p><p>one little</p><p>um piece of pink</p><p>one little one little uh crinoline piece</p><p>one little you know beautiful weird</p><p>things that women like</p><p>um out of my uh</p><p>out of my shadow into my consciousness</p><p>good and i'm willing now with the same</p><p>breaking i'm willing to become more</p><p>conscious</p><p>of what's right below the surface and</p><p>there's this big</p><p>um holding on to the male to the male</p><p>presentation uh and a lot of pain under</p><p>there i'm seeing so</p><p>it looks to me like you probably had</p><p>more than one but</p><p>um more a few big</p><p>punches in the jaw not not literally</p><p>that said you know get with the program</p><p>boy it's time to be a man</p><p>it's time to you know and um</p><p>we we won't have any of that we won't</p><p>have any of that</p><p>boyish girlish stuff out of you</p><p>and um that's very harmful so</p><p>uh that's part of the not wanting the to</p><p>under to</p><p>experience the soul because</p><p>unfortunately in our society the soul</p><p>has been</p><p>associated with the feminine and in some</p><p>ways</p><p>our receptivity is feminine but the soul</p><p>is not feminine</p><p>so maybe just let's get understand that</p><p>and just break sticks</p><p>soul is not feminine the soul has</p><p>receptivity</p><p>and it also has activity</p><p>okay yeah break sticks and you can</p><p>identify with the active part of the</p><p>soul</p><p>for the choosing the chooser to that for</p><p>the actor for the sayer for the goer</p><p>and um and i'm just gonna i have i have</p><p>like</p><p>something i'm very hard on i'm gonna</p><p>tell you because it might help you</p><p>um our our religions</p><p>have been designed mostly by men for</p><p>men um our religions and ours</p><p>and our spiritual practices and so</p><p>what men tend to need uh cisgendered men</p><p>tend to need is more</p><p>receptivity and so everybody's told be</p><p>more receptive let</p><p>go let go let go there they're trying to</p><p>get</p><p>the male to accept the feminine in way</p><p>without saying it</p><p>um and unfortunately</p><p>for women that is not helpful because we</p><p>already do this a lot and what we need</p><p>is this</p><p>and um and for men</p><p>it's hard because</p><p>we get so you guys get socialized</p><p>against</p><p>this yeah right so it's like it leaves</p><p>like it leaves everybody unserved so</p><p>i would i just want to say just break</p><p>sticks the male</p><p>is just as important in the soul as the</p><p>female</p><p>and so just let that soak in and you can</p><p>iden you can identify so to let yourself</p><p>into the soul experience more own the</p><p>male</p><p>part of the soul say oh my gosh</p><p>the male the active the male the chooser</p><p>the male the breaker through</p><p>the male the hunter the hat now the</p><p>the taker</p><p>all this wonderful male energy is in my</p><p>soul</p><p>and i can own it because i'm allowed</p><p>and just break sticks i'm allowed to do</p><p>to fall</p><p>into my soul i know that's a female word</p><p>i can drive into my soul</p><p>malward i'll i can drive into my soul</p><p>and experience it and act there</p><p>and then from there we can start to uh</p><p>say hello to the feminine but</p><p>just to let there you go okay and these</p><p>tools are very helpful because what are</p><p>we doing we're breaking sticks is</p><p>actually a male</p><p>action break sticks</p><p>so that you can experience more that you</p><p>are</p><p>breaking six you're breaking through</p><p>you're breaking old patterns</p><p>f this i this is</p><p>my deep</p><p>life there you go</p><p>and use that male energy to</p><p>um drive yourself</p><p>in to your soul experience</p><p>this is very important and i don't know</p><p>that anybody's talking about it</p><p>there we go good and just drive yourself</p><p>to the center of your head not like with</p><p>force but</p><p>in tension you know when we drive our</p><p>car it's not like</p><p>we're not trying to kill anyone we're</p><p>just driving along</p><p>just drive yourself to the center of</p><p>your head</p><p>drive around there hello center of head</p><p>good and</p><p>um let me see with the mail turn there</p><p>sit there like in your park lounger or</p><p>sitting going fishing you know something</p><p>male they get a male picture</p><p>you're sitting and you're sitting in</p><p>your boat in the driver's seat of your</p><p>boat</p><p>i don't mean to be so generous but i'm</p><p>just trying to find male imagery</p><p>right there you're sitting in the</p><p>driver's seat of your</p><p>of your car your boat your airplane your</p><p>rocket</p><p>whatever you're sitting there good and</p><p>you're noticing okay let's be in the</p><p>rocket</p><p>and you're noticing behind the rocket is</p><p>like this trail of</p><p>behind you and let that come out of your</p><p>body</p><p>that whatever that is the trail of</p><p>rocket stuff</p><p>down to the center of the earth</p><p>there we go okay so you're sitting in</p><p>the</p><p>little driver's seat of the rocket and</p><p>the whole back of the rocket is going</p><p>to the center of the earth good</p><p>good good</p><p>all right and this is a very funny</p><p>picture</p><p>so you're sitting in the rocket you're</p><p>in the rocket</p><p>stuff it's going out to back down to the</p><p>center of the earth</p><p>and you're like hey why is there no</p><p>radio around here you know</p><p>my my car has a good radio this rocket</p><p>doesn't have a radio</p><p>and just break sticks for the old</p><p>pattern and allow yourself oh here's the</p><p>radio</p><p>let me turn let me turn on the radio</p><p>here's the radio i'll turn it on we're</p><p>turning on your</p><p>hearing you're turning on you can hear</p><p>the the music of</p><p>of the spheres you can hear the</p><p>the angels sing turn on the radio</p><p>right and then center of head grounded</p><p>you're in the driver's seat of the</p><p>rocket</p><p>and break sticks oh you know they didn't</p><p>give me a</p><p>big enough view around here i just have</p><p>this little porthole</p><p>let me just break sticks and give myself</p><p>like a 360 view</p><p>around my around my head so i can see</p><p>all around i can see the moon and the</p><p>stars and the earth and i can see</p><p>everything and break sticks and let it</p><p>be</p><p>i can see i can hear i can see</p><p>good and</p><p>another fascinating thing and it's it's</p><p>really clear in you</p><p>um and this is unfortunately this</p><p>i mean men men do this to everyone but</p><p>but women especially uh moms especially</p><p>wives we</p><p>women want</p><p>you to be men and we want you</p><p>to kind of be on a leash</p><p>i want you not quite to have your full</p><p>range</p><p>of everything and just notice that the</p><p>the the rocket is just the rocket blast</p><p>whatever the heck that's called i'm</p><p>gonna call it the rocket blast it's</p><p>going all the way to the center of the</p><p>earth</p><p>and you are safe and you're here in the</p><p>driver's seat you can hear</p><p>you can see and the next thing that</p><p>comes up is your will</p><p>your free will and just break sticks i</p><p>see it all the time with men all the</p><p>time i do deep work</p><p>uh with men and um eventually most men</p><p>it but here it's right here for you</p><p>usually takes a few sessions</p><p>but you're just like i have a 10 foot</p><p>leash that's what i've got</p><p>you know you're a big dog with a big</p><p>bark and a big bite you know you're nice</p><p>like pitbull guy you know</p><p>but um with a big you know collar</p><p>and that's what you're allowed to have</p><p>you're not allowed to have the pink</p><p>collar or anything</p><p>but um but</p><p>you get a 10 fresh leash it's [ __ ]</p><p>so just break sticks it's [ __ ]</p><p>it's like you have to be strong and you</p><p>have to be this</p><p>and you have to be that but you're not</p><p>allowed to really use it</p><p>so let's just break sticks enough of</p><p>that i'm taking off</p><p>i'm taking off i'm breaking the thing</p><p>just between you and me and the apple</p><p>tree nobody knows</p><p>and you're just gonna take off the</p><p>collar</p><p>let the um lead it's really the lead</p><p>since the issue but we can take off the</p><p>collar</p><p>which affects your throat and your</p><p>ability to say and your ability to</p><p>create</p><p>but really it also really hooks into</p><p>um like your root it really hooks into</p><p>survival</p><p>oh to survive i have to stay with the</p><p>you know i have to stay in the box i've</p><p>seen the rules</p><p>of the family of the society of the</p><p>of the different parts of society the</p><p>church</p><p>the school the people and let's just</p><p>break that</p><p>you are an adult and the law is for</p><p>children</p><p>and so just break sticks and</p><p>spirit is the way break sticks and let's</p><p>allow um i can't see you but i hope you</p><p>can hear me</p><p>allow the root to let go of the</p><p>that that leash good and it's</p><p>you're it's replaced by your the rocket</p><p>blast</p><p>i am an adult in the center of my head</p><p>an adult body</p><p>as an adult soul and i am grounded to</p><p>the earth</p><p>i can be trusted i can make my own</p><p>choices</p><p>i'm not going to bite the male the mail</p><p>carrier</p><p>i i i'm fine i don't need the leash</p><p>there we go good</p><p>and center of head what do you notice</p><p>wait a minute one minute</p><p>uh my phone just went on a little power</p><p>mode that's where we</p><p>we got lost so i'm gonna grab the</p><p>charger</p><p>and start charging while we're talking</p><p>perfect</p><p>almost done no rush i'm just looking</p><p>i've wanted to be looking at your astral</p><p>experience anyway so i'm just looking</p><p>while you're away</p><p>never</p><p>okay i'm gonna have to make some</p><p>adjustments</p><p>so this will reach oh good</p><p>okay just a second almost done</p><p>okay back</p><p>great okay so you're grounded and</p><p>centered</p><p>uh what are you noticing anything</p><p>there's no answers frustration of not</p><p>being able to imagine</p><p>things as you're talking i i just really</p><p>can't</p><p>understand or connect with trying to get</p><p>into</p><p>breaking a stick or getting into the</p><p>center of my head</p><p>or visualizing a rocket or anything</p><p>like that i just my visualizations</p><p>are almost non-existent um</p><p>and i've always been like that i i just</p><p>i just didn't have any</p><p>any ability to visualize things</p><p>so what is what's your work been john</p><p>what do you do</p><p>for a living what have you done for a</p><p>living</p><p>a second everything</p><p>uh okay i had done many different things</p><p>but the last thing i did i was a uh</p><p>heating and cooling technician at the</p><p>detroit zoo</p><p>yeah i i've loved i loved being at with</p><p>the animals</p><p>didn't like being with the people but i</p><p>hear you um</p><p>so you'd go in and like there'd be</p><p>something that needed to be replaced or</p><p>whatever and</p><p>you'd have to fix it</p><p>yeah that that's what i was supposed to</p><p>do</p><p>yep didn't necessarily always do that</p><p>but</p><p>you know i did a lot of goofing off and</p><p>i really</p><p>got into some horrible work habits and i</p><p>hated myself for it so</p><p>anyway a lot of hating on though</p><p>jobs yeah</p><p>yeah you've been there's a lot of um</p><p>sliminess thickness in your space it's</p><p>hard to</p><p>it's hard to act it's hard to do stuff</p><p>um and that's what you've been</p><p>encouraged to do so it's a rock and a</p><p>hard place</p><p>um i'm just see like so you</p><p>when you did the job you'd go and you'd</p><p>see oh</p><p>this needs a new this or that or it</p><p>needs you know i need to</p><p>you know bring this around like i don't</p><p>know i'm not gonna have the words but</p><p>you have to bring the thing</p><p>from here to there i bring the heating</p><p>cooler</p><p>you have to replace this part or i would</p><p>have to tighten that belt or i'd have to</p><p>do something</p><p>was there ever anything that you had to</p><p>do</p><p>oh it can't go that way anymore i have</p><p>to bring it around the other way i have</p><p>to create a new thing</p><p>i was just fixing mostly just fixing</p><p>i don't know if i had to create anything</p><p>i i sometimes had to improvise</p><p>okay okay because i don't have a</p><p>left-handed thing i have to use two</p><p>right-handed things or whatever</p><p>and when you see that</p><p>would you just use your knowing you just</p><p>know oh i</p><p>i don't have this i know i need that but</p><p>you wouldn't see it you just know it</p><p>yeah yeah yeah</p><p>so that's knowingness and that we didn't</p><p>have to clear because it's already fine</p><p>that's the crown crown information and</p><p>of course we know with our brains we say</p><p>oh i know that</p><p>you know with our intellect but i'm not</p><p>talking about that i'm talking about the</p><p>soul capacity of just knowing the truth</p><p>or knowing</p><p>what needs to be happening knowing your</p><p>i used to be very much intuitive</p><p>in fact i do recall one time when i did</p><p>a different job</p><p>i told my boss something and he said</p><p>well how do you know that</p><p>and i i couldn't explain it i just knew</p><p>it and</p><p>and later on in the week</p><p>i got back into a similar area</p><p>and i noticed what it was that triggered</p><p>it so</p><p>then i found out that there was actually</p><p>a thermometer</p><p>that i saw that was not giving me</p><p>that was was not verifying information</p><p>so i i instinctively knew that</p><p>i needed uh to do something other than</p><p>what i normally would be told to do yes</p><p>yes so that i agree i call that also i</p><p>call that intuition</p><p>that's body information that we're not</p><p>conscious of</p><p>yeah okay um that's body body so that's</p><p>you know that's brain and</p><p>sometimes other things but it's usually</p><p>like just that's</p><p>stuff coming from our unconscious in our</p><p>brain</p><p>in ways that we're not conscious of so</p><p>that's really useful</p><p>that's like a body related thing and</p><p>then there's the soul related thing</p><p>we just know like um do you just know</p><p>that</p><p>do you just know that your connection</p><p>with spirit</p><p>just know it for no reason uh yeah</p><p>i i i just i i</p><p>question it but i know it sometimes</p><p>right</p><p>so you question it you intellectually</p><p>question it but you know it</p><p>yes right awesome great yeah that's yeah</p><p>good for you me too</p><p>um and then you know you cut</p><p>you came to several of my workshops</p><p>and i watched you like in you</p><p>consciously just</p><p>just you just go along you're just like</p><p>all right i'll go along with this crazy</p><p>stuff</p><p>you know all right like you just go</p><p>along i'm very compliant</p><p>but like and then you come back i'm just</p><p>like he's back</p><p>going along with this crazy stuff but</p><p>you ca you came several times and i'm</p><p>just like</p><p>he's not getting it consciously but he's</p><p>coming</p><p>why why</p><p>i don't know no idea why</p><p>right maybe knowing knowing there's</p><p>something</p><p>sensing uh something i guess and not</p><p>not necessarily with my mind but just</p><p>a sense yeah so maybe sensing</p><p>with your body or maybe you know body</p><p>senses i would say maybe knowing with</p><p>your</p><p>you know knowing this that there's</p><p>something going on here</p><p>i know i'm not seeing it but there's</p><p>something weird here that might be</p><p>useful</p><p>maybe um or something or maybe this is</p><p>knowing this</p><p>my way is here somewhere so anyway this</p><p>is knowingness that we're talking about</p><p>okay and uh i'm talking about the crown</p><p>chakra it um</p><p>it's its thing is knowing this clear</p><p>cognizance and</p><p>so we know how to connect to spirit we</p><p>know how to come</p><p>into the body and sit in the center of</p><p>the head</p><p>we know um we can connect to the akashic</p><p>records</p><p>which is like the um it's the uh</p><p>library of congress of seoul</p><p>all right right so you don't need to</p><p>know</p><p>everything here because who has space</p><p>for that</p><p>but we have library cards you know just</p><p>like what do i need to know now</p><p>um so anyway that's why like i would</p><p>like</p><p>i was looking it's like the two things</p><p>that i would you know that you might</p><p>consider</p><p>continuing to even though it means</p><p>nothing</p><p>break sticks and allow oh there is a</p><p>radio and i can turn it up to here</p><p>oh there is a um uh</p><p>what's it called which windshield around</p><p>here</p><p>i can i can let it be here it it</p><p>obviously it's not happening like that</p><p>but it can happen if you</p><p>keep asking for it does that make sense</p><p>ask and receive</p><p>yeah yeah it makes sense i've tried to</p><p>meditate</p><p>and i can't get into any kind of</p><p>every i always have the intruding</p><p>thoughts and i don't know</p><p>how to stop them right intruding</p><p>thoughts are normal</p><p>yeah i'm sure they are</p><p>and and uh they're they're intellectual</p><p>and they're</p><p>the stories that we live in upper throat</p><p>chakra stories to live in the stories</p><p>live in are always going</p><p>wow it actually helps create a reality</p><p>you know</p><p>a lot falls away when this falls away</p><p>um so uh</p><p>this the all the tools that you've done</p><p>with me all the things that we're doing</p><p>here this is active meditation</p><p>which for somebody like you might be a</p><p>good entree</p><p>because it's active it's more male it's</p><p>not just</p><p>sit down shut up because that doesn't</p><p>work</p><p>um eventually you keep practice if you</p><p>practice the active meditation</p><p>eventually</p><p>the the sit down shut up will work but</p><p>first of all you don't have access to</p><p>your feminine receptivity</p><p>you don't have access to it so it's just</p><p>like it doesn't work</p><p>i mean it can't work it's like the hot</p><p>water isn't connected so it can't flow</p><p>out the</p><p>pipe um so</p><p>you know we can work that you know you</p><p>can just ask for that to reconnect to</p><p>the feminine</p><p>and the other thing is that you have</p><p>pain and you have</p><p>fear and you have my experience you can</p><p>have your own experience</p><p>my experience is that you have fear and</p><p>pain and hate</p><p>and anger and [ __ ] a lot of</p><p>[ __ ] you know like who who can possibly</p><p>sit in that without</p><p>wanting to we can't sit in that</p><p>no so that's another thing about it</p><p>that's all there including depression</p><p>and anxiety</p><p>yeah yeah um which is being in the past</p><p>and being in the future</p><p>anything but here so</p><p>yeah so the idea is we utilize this</p><p>active meditation to say</p><p>oh let me break sticks or let roses come</p><p>and go let me break sticks for this</p><p>pain for this fear let it one stand at a</p><p>time drip out of my grounding</p><p>let one amount just disappear as i</p><p>explode a rose</p><p>um that's what this system is and i will</p><p>tell you</p><p>that um it took me a year</p><p>of doing creating because i came to this</p><p>system</p><p>i was bedridden i was</p><p>house bound i was bedridden a lot has</p><p>been for years</p><p>and um very very very ill and very very</p><p>you know psychically</p><p>in pain emotionally you know pain</p><p>relationally in pain</p><p>couldn't work obviously it was really</p><p>really really mess</p><p>and it took the first year i i couldn't</p><p>sit with</p><p>it you know i can't i couldn't just sit</p><p>with it but i could walk around the</p><p>block or i could watch a movie</p><p>or i could meditate with other people</p><p>and do some of these tools</p><p>i could do them while i walked around</p><p>the block because it was too intense to</p><p>sit in it</p><p>or i could do it well i swear i'd like</p><p>watch shows i'd watch like a funny show</p><p>and just do the tools</p><p>and i just let a rose come for pain come</p><p>and go come and go you can also break</p><p>sticks but i'd like a rose like i made a</p><p>i made a color i made like this</p><p>off-white color this</p><p>gray gray white color for pain</p><p>because that was my biggest issue pain</p><p>and i just let it come and go</p><p>all day long expl</p><p>and after about a year i was able to</p><p>start to</p><p>get closer to my body and closer to</p><p>starting to meditate on my own</p><p>um it was really intense um but it could</p><p>i could do it and i've come so far since</p><p>then it's been a while</p><p>so um</p><p>the the more eastern practices that we</p><p>know about</p><p>like uh zen or whatever they're for</p><p>people who</p><p>are in a different consciousness than</p><p>than</p><p>you are than i was then the people in</p><p>that consciousness would be just</p><p>peasants out working</p><p>um where with the kind of</p><p>intensity that you're in is really hard</p><p>to be with and that's</p><p>um so these tools are made in some ways</p><p>are made for that</p><p>to be able to dig out</p><p>so that you can be with your system does</p><p>that make sense</p><p>yeah yeah i guess</p><p>is this also being able to use to heal</p><p>the inner child yeah</p><p>um i have it it all does but i do have</p><p>specific ways to help with that yes</p><p>um that um we can't do today i mean i</p><p>can tell you what they are</p><p>some ways i've developed to do that but</p><p>um</p><p>let me see the thing is that</p><p>honestly it's very hard for you to just</p><p>to stay</p><p>here here now with</p><p>yourself and that's the first step of</p><p>caring for the inner child</p><p>sustaining here now with</p><p>okay you know being here now with with</p><p>your body</p><p>with your present in the present moment</p><p>i've been working on stuff like trying</p><p>to think about stuff like that</p><p>thinking about it is a good first step</p><p>honey i know i didn't get you to</p><p>birthday present but i did think about</p><p>it</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>anniversary and christmas whatever</p><p>right i thought about it</p><p>right and so like anyway yeah</p><p>yeah so anyway yeah</p><p>right and so thinking about it is</p><p>different than doing it</p><p>and doing it is that's what these tools</p><p>help us because these tools</p><p>help us to they're metaphors they're</p><p>just metaphors</p><p>but they're metaphors that help us</p><p>leverage into</p><p>underneath our everyday consciousness</p><p>would it be</p><p>advantageous to actually get some sticks</p><p>and break them</p><p>physically break them</p><p>you know that there's a lot of um</p><p>spiritual practices neopaganism uh for</p><p>example</p><p>that does stuff like that right they</p><p>sweep the floor</p><p>and say i'm sweeping out everything</p><p>negative</p><p>and they um use a</p><p>salt for you know to clear and say i'm</p><p>clearing or you</p><p>sage and say i'm clear right it's like</p><p>and that</p><p>it makes it real for the body yeah</p><p>but it doesn't mean that helps but it</p><p>doesn't have it</p><p>because it makes it real for the body it</p><p>makes it it might help you make it</p><p>easier for the soul</p><p>but it's all the soul that matters okay</p><p>so doing it just doing it in your</p><p>intention</p><p>i i know you can't see it so you're what</p><p>you're doing is you're doing it with</p><p>your hands</p><p>and you're intending you're knowing that</p><p>you're doing it</p><p>that's the important part just doing</p><p>this with your hands means nothing</p><p>okay so you've got it with the intention</p><p>no i know</p><p>that i am breaking the old bounds i know</p><p>i'm allowing this i know i'm letting go</p><p>of that</p><p>but that should be specific</p><p>things like i know i'm i'm breaking that</p><p>thought pattern or this you can do it in</p><p>general</p><p>but it still needs to be intentional</p><p>like just doing this</p><p>matters not but if you do this with the</p><p>intention</p><p>in my soul whatever needs breaking next</p><p>is breaking i</p><p>am breaking loose of the bounds that</p><p>have held me</p><p>and i'm breaking into a new</p><p>consciousness</p><p>okay okay i get that whatever general or</p><p>specific</p><p>mm-hmm okay um</p><p>there's been bounds on your on your</p><p>ankles and on your</p><p>ankles and uh wrists yeah no</p><p>you can know i'm breaking those bounds</p><p>and you know the feminine</p><p>i you know i mentioned i don't know if</p><p>it's it's it's it's uh</p><p>explicated in your life like this your</p><p>mom</p><p>your wife whatever it doesn't matter</p><p>sometimes it's very overt like that and</p><p>sometimes it's not but the feminine</p><p>element the feminine control</p><p>the feminine element that wants to</p><p>control the male</p><p>has has had you yeah</p><p>i believe that is so</p><p>important i'm breaking i'm breaking i i</p><p>it's so it's so i mean it's kind of</p><p>fascinating to look at you like this</p><p>because you're just</p><p>you're just textbook for my theory</p><p>uh my i i i'm a you know i'm a scientist</p><p>at heart i'm a soul scientist</p><p>and so i've had this theory and you are</p><p>just textbook as i look at you</p><p>about being stuck in the mail</p><p>uh here you have to act like this</p><p>you can't have that and we want to</p><p>control you</p><p>um and then if</p><p>you try to break out</p><p>you're bad yeah</p><p>you're well you're angry you're bad it's</p><p>like who wouldn't be angry</p><p>just who wouldn't be angry you're very</p><p>and i came into this being like we have</p><p>to work with anger</p><p>so we'll get to that um because anger is</p><p>your best friend</p><p>was considered my worst enemy</p><p>i was i was talk taught that we</p><p>shouldn't</p><p>show anger i was just taught that that</p><p>it wasn't</p><p>it wasn't acceptable yes yes</p><p>exactly and that makes you</p><p>if somebody takes away your anger that</p><p>makes you controllable and it</p><p>sets you in the victim place</p><p>okay meanwhile it doesn't mean you</p><p>should be cracking heads</p><p>mind you</p><p>good um it's anger angers and energy</p><p>we can use here and</p><p>then um then we care for ourselves it's</p><p>another</p><p>hugely important part of</p><p>caring for the inner child because who</p><p>stood</p><p>for you john who stood for you</p><p>when you were little who stood for you</p><p>who protected you</p><p>who made sure you were taken care of who</p><p>made sure that you</p><p>you you got your needs met who just who</p><p>i have no idea if anybody really did</p><p>[Music]</p><p>you didn't get hurt who did that for you</p><p>you're going in and out and it's it's</p><p>like breaking probably not</p><p>and so now it's your job your job</p><p>to do it for you</p><p>let me see this helps</p><p>[Music]</p><p>yes</p><p>[Music]</p><p>so it's your job to re-parent it's your</p><p>job</p><p>to care for yourself and protect</p><p>yourself</p><p>and anger can do that as to your body</p><p>and to your inner child i stand for you</p><p>enough of this</p><p>i don't know if you can hear me but the</p><p>screen is frozen</p><p>okay</p><p>um</p><p>okay</p><p>cam i'm back i had to log out</p><p>because everything was just frozen</p><p>okay i've restarted the internet</p><p>i'm in the main internet now hallelujah</p><p>i think my honey just went camping</p><p>this morning i think he undid stuff so</p><p>you know how it is he makes it better</p><p>and it gets worse</p><p>yeah um but i think that it's uh it's</p><p>good now</p><p>so um what's the last thing you heard</p><p>you were breaking up before that oh</p><p>i can't remember okay so our anger helps</p><p>us</p><p>oh yeah anger it was about it it helps</p><p>us</p><p>own our own space it helps us</p><p>be able to say yes and no like adults it</p><p>helps</p><p>us to protect our bodies</p><p>and our inner child in ways that we</p><p>haven't been protected</p><p>and that makes a space for the healing</p><p>of the inner child</p><p>so there must be constructive ways</p><p>to uh express anger</p><p>without being like an erupting volcano</p><p>yeah and what happens is we don't own</p><p>the if we don't own the anger and we</p><p>don't</p><p>um handle things ahead of time because</p><p>we're not allowed</p><p>then then every now and then we explode</p><p>yeah and that's what we don't want</p><p>um so yeah i'll show you and how how to</p><p>do the energy and it might not be</p><p>real for you because you're still</p><p>working on that but</p><p>i just i hope that you can let your</p><p>knowingness know</p><p>that it's working and um</p><p>and go from there so uh</p><p>that's if that's some of the theory okay</p><p>um you seem to go back and forth</p><p>like just just tell me you seem to be</p><p>kind of happy</p><p>going back and forth between like</p><p>christian and new age is that true where</p><p>i just so do i know how to talk to you</p><p>am i talking to you fine</p><p>you're talking fine and i do tend to</p><p>uh vacillate between the two i i find</p><p>help</p><p>in both areas perfect okay so</p><p>um i'm just going to talk to jesus</p><p>because um</p><p>about he said he could do this but i sh</p><p>i can introduce you there's this um i</p><p>was just</p><p>i was just talking to jesus about if you</p><p>we should say hi to him</p><p>and he is encouraging me to say hi to</p><p>who i like to play with with anger his</p><p>name is the red dragon</p><p>and he was um he was like a precursor to</p><p>the samurai</p><p>and he he shows up as a red dragon you</p><p>know but he was a</p><p>he was a warrior um that</p><p>he was you know his friends said you're</p><p>like a red dragon you know</p><p>um anyway i'm asking him to be in front</p><p>of us</p><p>and show us what owning owning our space</p><p>looks like</p><p>and you don't have to see him uh or hear</p><p>him but you could just know he's there</p><p>and let him help you inspire you to own</p><p>your space</p><p>all right and now from the center of</p><p>your head grounded</p><p>i'm i'm saying these things i just so</p><p>you know how i work i do it</p><p>and you do it because you're good at it</p><p>monkey see monkey do in our souls</p><p>i do it you do it and then i and i also</p><p>talk about it so you consciously can</p><p>tune in</p><p>and choose to do it yourself as much as</p><p>just use your knowingness use your</p><p>intention and say i am connected to the</p><p>earth</p><p>just because i say so even if i don't</p><p>notice</p><p>maybe you can notice a little bit more</p><p>weight in your chair or</p><p>a feeling of magnetism to the earth or</p><p>gravity they call it</p><p>yeah and then an</p><p>intention of center of head</p><p>good and you don't have to you don't</p><p>have to be good you don't have to be</p><p>perfect you don't have to try hard</p><p>you just come to the center of your head</p><p>good and let's break a few sticks</p><p>and let's say hi to the red dragon</p><p>and let's ask jesus to have your back</p><p>and um if you want you can ask him to</p><p>have your hand his hands on your</p><p>shoulders and heal you</p><p>around owning your full uh</p><p>full self in a male body</p><p>he owned his full self in a male body he</p><p>was very receptive</p><p>and very active he was very um</p><p>he embraced uh life he embraced</p><p>people he embraced his divine connection</p><p>and he then of course then he brought</p><p>into the world he prayed he acted</p><p>he did he said he changed the world</p><p>and he went he did it all at the same</p><p>time</p><p>you know we we think in terms of back</p><p>and forth but really all in the same</p><p>time</p><p>so yeah he went to the to the whatever</p><p>it was the hills or something at night</p><p>to be with the</p><p>pre with with the father</p><p>and he walked around in the day being a</p><p>presence of healing</p><p>and light so just allow</p><p>his beautiful balance of male and female</p><p>to inform your system and you don't have</p><p>to do</p><p>anything just just ask him and thank him</p><p>for being here and having your back</p><p>and um healing you with his hands on</p><p>your shoulders and his presence</p><p>informing your soul to</p><p>open to a beautiful infinity sign a</p><p>yin yang of of receptivity and activity</p><p>okay so head and let's say hi to the red</p><p>dragon the red dragon is a warrior</p><p>the red dragon puts up with no [ __ ] not</p><p>even one drop of [ __ ]</p><p>no aggravation</p><p>and he's like love on a stick he's love</p><p>in a male valence he's love in the male</p><p>body</p><p>he's a warrior and he's love</p><p>and just break sticks that is the</p><p>reality he's a warrior and he</p><p>is love</p><p>he is a warrior and he's completely</p><p>aligned with source</p><p>he's a warrior and he's got a mind that</p><p>is so</p><p>incisive and strategic</p><p>he's a warrior and his muscles and his</p><p>bones and his actions are so strong</p><p>and you are just sitting in front of him</p><p>learning</p><p>how to have male</p><p>activity male valence activity in a male</p><p>body</p><p>beautiful</p><p>good center of head grounded you're here</p><p>just keep breaking sticks so you can</p><p>allow yourself to</p><p>learn new tricks</p><p>good and this the anger</p><p>is has a male valence anger acts</p><p>anger says anger</p><p>does anger protects it's very male</p><p>uh valence male energy</p><p>but it's particular this anger is an</p><p>energy of the body</p><p>every body has it available</p><p>because we need it in this world</p><p>so in in your stomach in um</p><p>behind your belly button and a little</p><p>down</p><p>in the center of your of your belly</p><p>the center of your sacral chakra</p><p>um sacral chakra has to do with emotions</p><p>and sexuality desire it has to do with</p><p>um your body relationship and</p><p>communication emotions</p><p>um or feelings and from the center</p><p>of this place just know just allow</p><p>yourself to intend</p><p>that there's like a red</p><p>of water let's say a red fountain of</p><p>water coming up</p><p>and out from your belly up and out the</p><p>top of your head</p><p>and sprinkling only all around you all</p><p>around your aura and down</p><p>good and to me it lights up pain i'm not</p><p>allowed</p><p>shame i'm not allowed just let it flow</p><p>too [ __ ] bad</p><p>too bad the anger is flowing</p><p>the anger energy is flowing and the pain</p><p>is um this anger is is say it's see</p><p>it's warm let it be warm and let it melt</p><p>away</p><p>fear let it melt away pain let it melt</p><p>away shame</p><p>let it melt away the the</p><p>bonds that have kept you good</p><p>and i'm noticing it's just coming up</p><p>like just somewhat it's just a red</p><p>fountain of red water that's all</p><p>up and out the top of your head you</p><p>don't have to see it just know what's</p><p>happening</p><p>it is happening and i'm just noticing</p><p>letting you reeling near your body as it</p><p>comes down</p><p>like like you're in the shower red</p><p>uh water coming down around your body</p><p>it's</p><p>it's not it's not bad it's not acidy</p><p>it's not bad it's</p><p>it's a panacea it's like a balm a</p><p>b-a-l-m</p><p>it's like a bomb of but it's a bomb of</p><p>action it's like</p><p>it's like yeah mom</p><p>might um rock in the chair</p><p>and feed me and clothe me let's say</p><p>but dad when i'm asleep in the back seat</p><p>might</p><p>take me up in strong arms and carry me</p><p>in the archetypal maybe</p><p>didn't happen for you but archetypal</p><p>just</p><p>scoop me up like i'm nothing and carry</p><p>me in and put me in my bed and</p><p>pet me like it's that male</p><p>comforting safe protective</p><p>active service</p><p>let the anger move like this that's what</p><p>you're in</p><p>you're in the male active force</p><p>that's a that's a</p><p>it's a protection and it's beautiful and</p><p>it's i just</p><p>as you run this i just want to say you</p><p>know and let it be like a shower you're</p><p>in the shower it's coming up through you</p><p>and then you're in the shower all around</p><p>you</p><p>all around you a red shower because i'm</p><p>just working with your aura here</p><p>there's so much in your body we'll get</p><p>to it but just in your aura there's so</p><p>much</p><p>there's so much invalidation like shame</p><p>and there's so many</p><p>uh and lies and there's so many</p><p>heaviness some</p><p>um the emotions of like of pain</p><p>and there's fear and there's all this</p><p>stuff and so we're just letting the</p><p>anger flow it away</p><p>letting the anger float away</p><p>i just want to validate for you that men</p><p>you know it's very hard like men get</p><p>blamed for so much and at the same time</p><p>um men get held back so much</p><p>there's just no winning and just break a</p><p>few sticks and let anger flow</p><p>and let let's be let there be space for</p><p>you to be</p><p>and you know but the next thing time of</p><p>prowler's coming along</p><p>come on come on you go do it</p><p>you know it's like you go save me</p><p>it's just like what what does that male</p><p>action what does that</p><p>anger protective no you're not messing</p><p>with me</p><p>not you know not in my house not my</p><p>people</p><p>this is the energy we need to be like</p><p>you don't mess with me</p><p>my people my house my stuff</p><p>my walk with god you do not mess what</p><p>gets us there</p><p>this good</p><p>it also has us deal with problems way</p><p>before they explode</p><p>because it might not be a prowler it</p><p>just might be some guy walking through</p><p>the backyard</p><p>cutting through because he's drunk or</p><p>whatever and oh hi buddy yeah</p><p>all right everything's fine it doesn't</p><p>have to be a big deal</p><p>but we were action we're in</p><p>communication</p><p>good good good good good it's very</p><p>important that we don't heal</p><p>too much you're very capable spiritually</p><p>you're very fast you're very capable</p><p>but i just want to say we can't do this</p><p>forever because it's intense</p><p>all right and now in your body just let</p><p>the idea that the white</p><p>fountain i mean the red fountain is</p><p>coming</p><p>not just up straight up through you but</p><p>kind of spraying up all through you as</p><p>it sprays up</p><p>it's just like waters pushing around you</p><p>know in the big</p><p>um in the big fields when they water</p><p>with the</p><p>those those pipes that go through they</p><p>don't just</p><p>come and go up they and they have this</p><p>like flipper thing that like</p><p>meant to go all over the place</p><p>so just let this red water just go all</p><p>over the damn place through your body</p><p>melting away so much heaviness</p><p>good and then in the center of your head</p><p>i know it</p><p>you might not experience it but just ask</p><p>energy of me</p><p>my energy my me from the past</p><p>please return and just ask for it to</p><p>just</p><p>fear you know like uh metaphorically</p><p>come from behind you</p><p>little sparks of light of your own</p><p>attention into the center of your house</p><p>head coming out of uh the past and when</p><p>i have too much of my energy in the past</p><p>i'm depressed because</p><p>i'm taking all my energy</p><p>back there instead of here i have no</p><p>energy here so bring your energy and</p><p>attention back from the past</p><p>and let it like a magnet in the center</p><p>of your head lit let the iron filings of</p><p>your</p><p>attention in the past come back gently</p><p>to the center of your head</p><p>as the anger flows good and now</p><p>little pieces of of metal</p><p>coming from the future</p><p>out of the future back to now</p><p>it's very normal we go out there we try</p><p>to make sure but nothing bad happens we</p><p>try to create good things</p><p>uh but it scares the body because we're</p><p>way out into the future the body</p><p>can't access it can't help it can't</p><p>change it just like the past</p><p>can't can't do anything so come here</p><p>with your attention and energy come here</p><p>come here come home</p><p>home free home out of all the places the</p><p>hiding places come home</p><p>good and notice the red coming up</p><p>spraying all over the place</p><p>just intend it you don't have to see it</p><p>you don't have to hear it</p><p>you don't have to touch it feel it just</p><p>know that it's happening</p><p>good</p><p>i'm allowed to own my own space i'm</p><p>allowed to own my own life</p><p>i'm allowed to own my own soul i'm</p><p>allowed to take care</p><p>of myself i'm allowed to protect myself</p><p>i'm allowed to care for my own</p><p>inner child and protect him i'm allowed</p><p>to care for my own um property my own</p><p>space</p><p>and from there of course i protect and</p><p>take care of</p><p>out from there because just try to stop</p><p>me but</p><p>in here is where i really need it</p><p>who am i without this beautiful i love</p><p>to hear that that's identity talking</p><p>who am i without this who am i without</p><p>all this who am i who am i with</p><p>owning my space that's crazy talk</p><p>yeah who am i owning my anger that's</p><p>crazy talk</p><p>so if you want break a few sticks</p><p>the only change change is only allowed</p><p>to happen if</p><p>if we allow change in identity and</p><p>that's dying daily that's dying to who</p><p>we think we are and what we</p><p>what we think we're supposed to be and</p><p>how we think we're supposed to be and</p><p>what we think god wants us and what we</p><p>think everybody else wants us or</p><p>whatever</p><p>we believe uh the past and we break</p><p>into a new reality of more freedom</p><p>there you go i can</p><p>i can do this good center of head</p><p>grounding</p><p>so two questions</p><p>i don't know if you've noticed anything</p><p>but if you do let me know</p><p>but more importantly that you understand</p><p>the</p><p>intention because you're doing it and</p><p>um red dragon is in front of you</p><p>inspiring you</p><p>jesus is behind you inspiring you what</p><p>do you notice is going on what are you</p><p>what are your what are your questions</p><p>i just</p><p>i like the fact that i don't have to</p><p>feel things but i can</p><p>actually just tell myself that that's</p><p>what's going on</p><p>that that the fountain's coming out of</p><p>my head or red dragons in front of me</p><p>and</p><p>jesus is behind me and that it's okay to</p><p>it's okay to be angry</p><p>there's just uh it's okay to be who i am</p><p>and find out who i am yeah</p><p>amen amen</p><p>so in doing this did you notice any</p><p>of your usual feelings of anger</p><p>i can't say that i did maybe a few</p><p>fleeting</p><p>that just came in and out just</p><p>remembering times when i got angry yeah</p><p>why great um that will happen because</p><p>you're clearing the old</p><p>anger um and that's part of it like i</p><p>was saying</p><p>fear and i was saying shame and i was</p><p>saying</p><p>oh what's that thing um pain but also</p><p>clearing the old anger is very helpful</p><p>you have tons of it</p><p>you have tons of old anger um</p><p>because you haven't known what to do</p><p>with it you're just told not to have it</p><p>but you do have it</p><p>it's crazy making and it's so it stopped</p><p>everything up</p><p>so um so just letting this anger flow</p><p>uh it's warm like warmer mountain ice</p><p>and i know you're not seeing the colors</p><p>yet but just</p><p>just fyi i tend to see old anger is like</p><p>blood dried blood red kind of color</p><p>um whereas the fresh anger is fire</p><p>engine you know it's just</p><p>fresh anger uh red</p><p>um and so just know that there's two</p><p>flavors that old stuff is just useless</p><p>because</p><p>the poo the purpose of all of</p><p>our feelings is to communicate from the</p><p>body to</p><p>us in the moment in the very moment</p><p>any of the old stuff is just</p><p>packed away in the way it doesn't help</p><p>us</p><p>doesn't help us because when the anger</p><p>flares</p><p>that's when we know oh that</p><p>get off my foot you're on my toe get off</p><p>my toe</p><p>right in the very moment and we don't</p><p>have to say it like that we could say</p><p>oh i'm taking care of myself oh i'm</p><p>angry okay let me</p><p>let anger flow i'm taking care of me</p><p>body what's happening</p><p>they don't even realize they're on my</p><p>toe oh would you kindly</p><p>you know get your high shoe off of my</p><p>toe oh that's so great thank you</p><p>we don't have to when we own our anger</p><p>we're taking care of ourselves and we</p><p>don't have to go</p><p>we can then choose to</p><p>um be sweet as sweet as pie</p><p>or you know direct and assertive or</p><p>there's times off of my foot</p><p>is the appropriate response but not as a</p><p>reaction as an action</p><p>okay does that make sense yeah yeah</p><p>so so if the idea is first we oh</p><p>whether you know in real life when i'm</p><p>angry</p><p>like i'm feeling it i have those</p><p>chemicals the body makes the chemicals</p><p>and i'm like you know</p><p>but like you know i'm socialized</p><p>similarly to you like i don't have a lot</p><p>of um</p><p>i wasn't socialized to have any room for</p><p>that um</p><p>so i let the anger flow in me and i</p><p>really i use the</p><p>the picture if this helps you i use the</p><p>picture of the rocket</p><p>but the rocket that i use for anger</p><p>picture is that i'm still in cape</p><p>canaveral</p><p>and i'm still hooked down but the fire</p><p>is coming out</p><p>okay and but i'm still i'm hooked down</p><p>and i the fire goes all the way to the</p><p>center of the earth and it helps me stay</p><p>grounded and when i stay</p><p>grounded conscious of my connection to</p><p>the earth</p><p>and let the anger run then i stay in</p><p>control of myself even when i'm insanely</p><p>angry</p><p>and then like to rage and i say hi to</p><p>the red dragon</p><p>and i rage and i do it here</p><p>and then on the outside of me i can</p><p>choose and i can say i ran a psychic</p><p>school i helped run a psychic school i</p><p>was a co-director for</p><p>almost five years and i'd have these</p><p>management meetings with a bunch of</p><p>psychic teachers</p><p>and it was like you know i just wanted</p><p>to shoot them on the head</p><p>you know it was like incessant [ __ ]</p><p>right it was just incessant</p><p>and they're all psychics and i'm running</p><p>anger</p><p>so many times so many of the meetings</p><p>i'm just running anger like it's saving</p><p>my life</p><p>right and sitting there and they don't</p><p>even know</p><p>i'm angry because it's all here</p><p>and then outside i can say what can we</p><p>do about this</p><p>how can you handle that how can we have</p><p>you be on time</p><p>how can we write like</p><p>yeah but but it wouldn't have helped me</p><p>to be</p><p>raging on the outside it doesn't help</p><p>but so instead i took care of myself</p><p>i let the anger hold me to here now</p><p>so i didn't go flying out with a bunch</p><p>of f's coming out of my face</p><p>and then i could act but it gave me</p><p>enough push to be just like we need to</p><p>fix this problem</p><p>instead of just being like a victim and</p><p>being like oh whatever i can't</p><p>i can't make any difference</p><p>does it make any sense yeah</p><p>so it's all practice it doesn't you know</p><p>when we start it doesn't</p><p>uh make any difference but maybe if you</p><p>said hello to this as a practice</p><p>grounded centered run anger with jesus</p><p>and red dragon</p><p>even five minutes um</p><p>and then hopefully longer what we did</p><p>today</p><p>did move out a bunch of stuff you you're</p><p>just packed</p><p>packed and packed and packed with so</p><p>many</p><p>emotions old emotions</p><p>and i'll just say it's like emotions are</p><p>like telegrams we need them in the</p><p>moment oh</p><p>just had a baby ooh you know in the old</p><p>days they had telegrams</p><p>and so we get all these telegrams but if</p><p>we won't read them they just stack up on</p><p>the desk</p><p>and then like they were like oh my god</p><p>i can't handle this the desk is just</p><p>full of telegrams and when new ones come</p><p>we can't even see or hear them we don't</p><p>know they're there</p><p>yeah stop being able to feel</p><p>but things just get worse and so the</p><p>idea here was the anger is we're just</p><p>like throwing them all in the fire</p><p>we're just taking telegrams and throwing</p><p>them in the in the</p><p>in the burning um what's the word trash</p><p>can</p><p>throwing telegrams in the print trash</p><p>can and then we get a clean desk</p><p>and then when new telegrams come we can</p><p>notice them and say</p><p>oh i'm really not happy about this</p><p>i need you to get off my foot oh i'm so</p><p>sad i</p><p>i'm dealing with this loss okay body</p><p>okay</p><p>lunar child let's take a few minutes and</p><p>just</p><p>i'll be with you we can we can</p><p>appropriately start</p><p>and takes a minute but we can probably</p><p>start to take care of our body</p><p>and the emotions that are happening</p><p>okay okay</p><p>so that's more than enough for today um</p><p>so you got a bunch of i'll send you the</p><p>there's probably more than one</p><p>audio of this because we we had a break</p><p>or two</p><p>um in the middle but i'll send you those</p><p>audios</p><p>um you have tools if you want to</p><p>practice</p><p>i'm doing stuff thursday nights did you</p><p>see that that i have thursday night</p><p>thing</p><p>yes i did and i did sign up</p><p>and i got the confirmation for the link</p><p>perfect okay um</p><p>so uh</p><p>you see that one-on-one can really help</p><p>um because we got down to some things</p><p>that are</p><p>that are general things but it's a lot</p><p>of stuff we dealt with today</p><p>it doesn't come in classes for a long</p><p>time</p><p>um if you um</p><p>if you want to invest in working
