When I need love from others, or need to give love to others, I’m caught in an unstable situation. Being in love, rather than giving or taking love, is the only thing that provides stability. Being in love means seeing the Beloved all around me.</p><p>I’m not interested in being a “lover.” I’m interested in only being love. In our culture we think of love as a relational thing: “I love you” and “you are my lover.” But while the ego is built around relationship, the soul is not. It wants only to be love.<br/><br/>AND - oneness requires safety, comfort, ease - including boundaries - ring and setting<br/>how is the Divine expression in each chakra, to bring spirit into the world?<br/></p></li><li><p><strong> Empath </strong><br/><strong>what does Success or wellness or Healthy-fruit… look-like - in the World/Soul/Body - and how do we Dance this?</strong><br/>2 major issues - all ENERGY, not physical <br/>1) managing healthy energy system to perceive, but not be overwhelmed. To care-for and value body, not just spirit. Turn the knobs top and down. Radio becomes a blessing when it isn’t screaming at 10.<br/>2) <br/>staying in MY Own LANe<br/><br/>- martyr pictures - I need to suffer - someone needs to suffer, it might as well be me. <br/>- savior pictures - I am special and have to save the world, so I will not rise unless all rise. <br/>(Sadly the opposite is what works: I rise and show what can be done and how - be the first to break the one-minute mile)<br/>- hero pictures- I Have to carry their backpack - because they can’t (I’m better) <br/>(It hurts them to do homework for 3rd graders - and most of us are 3rd graders, in one way or another)<br/>- invalidation/need &amp; lonely pictures - I receive love by healing-healping-giving-serving others <br/>- confusing spiritual and physical pictures- I think love means no boundaries. This creates enmeshment, unclarity, co-dependence. <br/>Somehow, I didn’t get the memo that we are here to play I/Thou Game <br/>(disambiguation, separation, self-actualization)<br/><br/><br/>see audio with Dawn Jan 28, 2021 07:38 PM - <br/>2ndHalf.MoneyBizCoaching.1stHalf.LBHsupportDawnWendy <br/><br/>Ram Das<br/><br/>He shifted from his old consciousness to higher - when in presence of his teacher <br/>and then some other guy gave him all the theory and practices <br/>(which helped him continue on his journey, and have something to share - since at least at first, his presence didn’t shift others, as his teacher’s did)<br/><br/><br/>LSD  - drugs can be doorway, but not the answer - like vacation - have to go back <br/>spiritual amazing experience and addiction similar in that we can take a bridge across and visit <br/>but to live there, must go to the headwaters, and around <br/><br/>Ram Das quote on Love </p></li></ol><p><br/>Mat 6 <br/><br/><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>9</strong></a>So then, this is how you should pray: </p><p>‘Our Father in heaven, </p><p>hallowed be Your name.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-10.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>10</strong></a>Your kingdom come, </p><p>Your will be done, </p><p>on earth as it is in heaven.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-11.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>11</strong></a>Give us this day our daily bread.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-12.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>12</strong></a>And forgive us our debts, </p><p>as we also have forgiven our debtors.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>13</strong></a>And lead us not into temptation, </p><p>but deliver us from the evil one.<a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/6.htm#fn" rel="nofollow"><em>b</em></a>’</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>14</strong></a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. <a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-15.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>15</strong></a>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours.</p><p>Proper Fasting</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>16</strong></a>When you fast, do not be somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.
