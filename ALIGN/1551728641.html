                    <p><strong>Objective &amp; Consent for Care at Nourish &amp; Flourish</strong></p><p>The intention of this document is to help you better understand the nature of the services provided at Nourish &amp; Flourish and the relationship between the Practitioners and you, the Practice Member. Having a mutually aligned agreement promotes a greater sense of safety and increased opportunity for healing and access to well being.</p><p>By reading and signing this form, you are requesting and consenting to receive spinal care and embodiment guidance by doctors of chiropractic, Brian T. Lumb and Chelsea Rae Verslues, who provide an honoring approach which has unique outcomes and results.</p><p>ThisofficeprovidesCareinaccordancewiththe<em>C</em>​ <em>ouncilonChiropracticPracticeGuidelines​</em>. The doctors have been trained in traditional chiropractic methods, certified in Network Spinal Analysis, and now provide their own unique style of care that has shown, based on decades of personal and professional experience, to be as safe and even more effective.</p><p>The care the doctors provide does not attempt to manipulate spinal fixations structurally (often associated with a cracking or popping sound), nor does it directly treat disease or painful areas of the spine and body. <strong>I</strong>​ <strong>nstead, this method enhances your body’s awareness of itself and specifically your spine, so your physiology can develop new pathways for healing, adapting to stress, and experiencing wellness. These pathways allow for organic self-correction and self-regulation of body tension patterns.</strong></p><p><strong>These new pathways teach your body to shift from a tense, protected, (e.i. inefficient) state, to one of ease, connection, and growth in a sustainable and progressive way.</strong></p><p>Your care will include table sessions in a group setting where the doctor makes gentle contacts along the neck, back, and pelvis; these take place in about 10-15 minutes. The contacts create greater communication between the brain and body and to develop these new sensory and motor pathways. Sessions are in a group setting to give time for your body to integrate each contact and utilize the power of healing in community to support your faster and easier progress through care.</p><p>Once care is started, progress evaluations will be performed at regular intervals. These will include asking you about changes you are noticing relative to your body’s response to care, symptom changes, concerns, and desires for growth. Your doctor will also report to you on the improvement of your spine and nerve system integrity and the progress of care.</p><p>The care at Nourish &amp; Flourish progresses much like learning a language. Your physiology will first learn to automatically release tension through increased breath and body-brain connection, then increase range of motion and emotion through stretch, next your body will be free enough</p><p><strong>347 Depot Street, suite 201 | Asheville, NC | 828.255.2770</strong></p><p>to express coordinated spinal movements that establish lasting new neural patterns. All of this new body “language” translates into greater well being: decreased pain, increased pleasure sensation, emotional ease and authentic expression, aligned action, mental clarity and focus, awareness of life purpose and feelings of fulfilment. This is the language of humans being.</p><p>Please read and sign the following:</p><p>It has been explained to my satisfaction, and I understand that the care offered at Nourish &amp; Flourish is not a form of, or a replacement for, a diagnosis or treatment of any symptom, disease, or malady. It is a form of wellness care and learning that empowers my connection to my body, mind, and spirit. This care gives my body the new ability to identify, naturally release, and redirect tension.</p><p>My body will learn to breathe more fully, engage the spine with breath, naturally adapt postures to release or redirect tension, and shift stress into usable energy to own and create my life. I understand that I will experience a wider range of motion and emotion during care, and that <strong>t</strong>​ <strong>his care leads to a person’s natural desire to create change that is aligned with their inner and outer well-being.</strong></p><p><strong>This form of care is not suggested for those who wish to only remove a symptom or condition without the occurrence of other fundamental changes in their lives. The growth and healing-related changes that are yours to make will become more clear as you become more connected to your body in this process of care.</strong></p><p><strong>Rather than attempting to simply remove a symptom, my practitioner chooses to help me achieve new levels of wellbeing and life potential that I may never have had before.</strong></p><p>I have read, or have had read to me, this document and understand that the care in this office is different from what many consumers may expect from chiropractors. I agree to receive care, which includes sessions on the table and embodiment guidance. I understand that I am not passive in this process; I am an active participant in my progress and my healing. I further understand and agree that the practitioners in this office may consult together and share my history and information to support my care.</p><p>__________________________________________ ____________________</p><p>SIGNATURE OF PRACTICE MEMBER</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>PRINT NAME OF PRACTICE MEMBER</p><p>​DATE</p><p>FEEL ALIVE, VITAL, JOYOUS, AND FREE </p>
