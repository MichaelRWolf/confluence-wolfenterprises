My leading going into the next year is, IF I wanna offer more, I need to work with others starting Now ; )</p><p><br/></p><p>Add 2 new beginner courses - prolly, one in January, one in April????</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Long-term, Seattle-based vision:</p><p><br/></p><ol><li><p /></li></ol><p>Business incubators are getting popular here in Seattle.</p><ul><li><p>training and resources and support for start-ups </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>for customer development - what real needs are, and how they can be effectively met </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>focus of business, etc</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>For example, some great lists here: <a class="external-link" href="http://startupseattle.com/resources/" rel="nofollow">http://startupseattle.com/resources/</a></p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>One of my many visions ; )</p><p>is to provide a ministry incubator for spiritual healers and leaders </p><p>(i support and assist folks spiritually to be spiritual healers, teachers and leaders, but what I would like to add is the physical-life element, the material/community development/business world aspect that is not what I offer - this is where I and so many ‘ministers’ are woefully young ; )</p><ul><li><p>provide physical and spiritual resources for them and their unique ministries to thrive, as well as professional community to support and be supported.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I would love to encourage non-Sunday worship &amp; fellowship as well as support/learning for folks who work on Sundays - it is vital for us spiritually to be ministered-to, not just to be the minister all the time… not just to avoid burn-out, but to nurture our continued spiritual healing and deepening - unrelated to our ministry.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>this ministry incubator would be within a community of spiritual healers and leaders, </p><p>and that within a wider community of folks who are seeking and finding spiritual healing, focus, inspiration, support for their unique journey...</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I thought it might.</p><p><br/></p><p>A lot of folks who are drawn to serve God, aren't always such good friends with money - that is a blocker for service, for easy and fun ministry... when we don't know how money works, or even have layers of issues around utilizing money as a tool.</p><p><br/></p><p>I have never been rich, sometimes we have comfortable amounts sometimes less.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have struggled with God about money every which way over my lifetime.</p><p>Most Particularly around charging for my services.</p><p><br/></p><p>But, I am led to charge, and I do.  </p><p>Even though I would Much Rather live in a cave and do it for free. </p><p>But, that isn't my lot ; )</p><p>And, I deal with a lot of push-back and judgment from others -&gt; how dare I charge!</p><p><br/></p><p>It is a very uncomfortable place to operate - and all the suffering I have done about this is completely unnecessary.  </p><p>I have students who have not launched, in the end, becasue they just can't handle the money thing around spiritual services. So, they get a regular job... don't break out.</p><p><br/></p><p>This must be handled.</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>And more to the point, many folks are trained to be able to serve and heal and help - so many called to ministry know to ask God to bring info and wisdom - overtly as well as within from the HS, etc.</p><p><br/></p><p>But, many don't train or understand or even really know that we need to understand how the world works, how business works.  </p><p>We don't even know that we don't know.  </p><p>We don't even know to ask God to help us learn...</p><p><br/></p><p>I know SO little, enough to know I am an idiot at business (so far ; )</p><p>I am learning, as I am led.</p><p>And the times I have brought biz resources to my students for their use - it is amazing how much resistance comes up.</p><p><br/></p><p>I have realized as part of their spiritual training, we need to deal with money and business - head-on - to clear the spiritual issues, blocks, agreements, etc. </p><p><br/></p><p>AND - I need to provide them with even more resources and support - from the other side - the physical world - real business asssitance and modeling. I am not well-equipped to do this yet, but I am gaining allies and paradigms.</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>All this has me see, me and my friends are not alone in this.</p><p>Presumably mainline churches deal with this stuff in some structured way - i suppose.</p><p>but there are hordes of us, called to serve, who are stopped, or at least burdened unnecessarily becasue of our resistance-to and ignorance-of money and business.</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>I personally have felt aggravated about God calling me to deal with business and money, becasue it would be easy for this to be somehow miraculously handled </p><ul><li><p>my partner makes good money, when he is in the right positions... </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>people could just magically find me and what I offer could be an overnight sensation ; )</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>But, that is not the path for me.  (place expletives here ; )</p><p>I need to Learn Money and Business.  (place expletives here ; )</p><p>And, I have only recently been seeing the wisdom and beauty of this.</p><p><br/></p><p>for a long time I thought it was becasue it helps me heal and grow and grow-up and deal with real life like everyone else, deal with issues of unworthiness and patterns of putting everyone ahead of me, etc etc</p><p><br/></p><p>and that is all real and true and useful</p><p><br/></p><p>But, I believe and have experienced in my ministry </p><ul><li><p>where we trip is our treasure - </p></li></ul><p>there are always more gifts than meet the eye, where we oft stumble, where we can't move-up-from.</p><p><br/></p><p>In that vein, I have been starting to see how very needful it is for a lot of folks to learn these things - many of us in 'ministry' need to learn these things.</p><p><br/></p><p>People don't have to learn these SO MANY THINGS randomly, and the hard way, We can find a way to help folks in this oft-bloody and draining - sometimes soul killing - process.</p><p><br/></p><p>Spiritual leaders and healers can learn how to structure and offer our gifts with ease and grace.</p><p><br/></p><p>And as we do, we can heal, grow, assist others with more ease and grace - and share with all, the powerful levers that come as one is senior to money, when one can captain their business, as well as their lives.</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>Money is not evil. </p><p>Business is not evil. </p><p>They are energies, structures...games to be learned </p><p>and played to win (as we are led ; )</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>I don't have too much more specifically - i gave general pictures above.</p><p>All the info is already out there - being used to make toasters and offer yet more apps in the world.  </p><p>The scheme (vision ; ) is to bring this info to folks who have a heart for God, and for serving All Our Relations; in ways that are palatable and useful. </p><p>In ways that folks can be wise as serpents and gentle as doves in this real life we are called to live and serve-in. </p><p><br/></p><p>Along with other resources and community to help folks body, mind, spirit along their unique way in God.</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>What do you notice here?</p><p>There is overlap in your ministry - what are you seeing, learning, doing?</p><p><br/></p><p>: )W</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
