Your Own Space (if time permits)</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Ground and run energy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Since a man's body develops inside his mother's female body, he starts to find his own space the day of birth.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>It can be said that a man's main goal in life is to separate from his mothers energy.    Notice the amount of your mothers energy you have already separated from.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Put up a gauge for how much of your own male energy you have been able to run in your body.    (read gauge)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ground energy of limits off gauge.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Put up a rose for present time male space.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Draw rose and describe to class.</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VIII.
