And I do a bit of wood carving when I need a change of pace.</p><p>I moved to the Pacific Northwest to write and to have a modest private psychotherapy practice in a small town not much bigger than a village, where I had the privilege of working with amazing people. But eventually I realized it was time to put my focus on my writing, where, through the world-shrinking internet, I could interact with a greater number of people. Where I could meet you!</p><p>Thank you reading my work. Your support contributes to sustaining this little corner of the earth, ten acres of natural forest, and all its resident fauna and flora.</p><p>I'd love to hear from you if you have thoughts, questions, or observations about my work, or are curious to know more about my life: <a class="external-link" href="mailto:Blythe@BlytheAyne.com" rel="nofollow">Blythe@BlytheAyne.com</a></p><p />
