To refine the messaging, you may want to consider focusing on the benefits that your target audience can expect to receive from your practices, such as increased confidence, better communication skills, and a greater sense of inner peace. You can also try to make the language more concise and specific, avoiding abstract concepts and focusing on concrete actions that readers can take to improve their lives. Additionally, you may want to consider including more information about the specific practices you recommend, such as examples of validated communication or strategies for setting natural boundaries.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" data-image-src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" loading="lazy"></span><p>This is targeted to mystics and creatives about learning how to love.

I want it to be clear that people will find the love they want to see in the (secular) world by finding it within themselves. Not only will that make them more effective in their relationships and communication, but it will also open up a whole different experience within themselves. A sacred experience. The outside world doesn't need to know this, but they will notice that the world will respond to them differently. AND... having gotten the RESULTS they wanted, they get an extra bonus that will make their life more meaningful, joyful, and connect with a sense of the devine.</p><p>Thank you for the clarification!

Sometimes, sharing our vulnerability and our growth can make it more real and help us integrate it more deeply.</p><p>While we have plans for future sessions, we won't hard sell them to you. Instead, we want you to know that you're always welcome to reach out to us and share your thoughts or ask for support.

I find that I am continually enrolling people every week. Every week I generate new material. It does pull in some new people, but it feels like starting over each time. What is a good strategy to make sure that attendees (especially new clients) keep engaged and build week over week so that I don't have to continually convince them of the benefit they are receiving.</p><p>One effective strategy for keeping attendees engaged and building week over week is to create a community around your Love Mastery workshop. You can create a private Facebook group or a Slack channel where attendees can connect with each other, share their experiences, ask questions, and receive support.</p><p>In addition, you can consider offering ongoing support and accountability to attendees. For example, you could offer a coaching program or a monthly membership that includes regular group coaching calls, personalized support, and additional resources and tools to help attendees deepen their practice.</p><p>Another strategy is to incorporate experiential exercises and practices in each session that build on the previous ones. This will help attendees see the progression of their growth and feel motivated to continue. You could also consider offering &quot;homework&quot; or suggested practices between sessions to help attendees stay engaged and continue their growth.</p><p>Finally, make sure to follow up with attendees after each session to check in on their progress, answer any questions they may have, and offer additional support as needed. By building a supportive community and offering ongoing support and accountability, you can help attendees stay engaged and build on their progress week over week.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" data-image-src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" loading="lazy"></span><p>What you have created is very good with a marketing tone and appeal to logical reasoning for measurable results. I want to point to the value of less tangible results. These workshops access those results by being indirect, like poetry. Please rewrite the whole pre-session announcement by adding more poetic elements like imagery, metaphor, alliteration, analogy, and sensory language to pull in smells, sights, sounds, and feelings.</p><p>Certainly, I can assist you with that. Here's a reimagined version of the pre-session announcement that incorporates more poetic elements:</p><hr/><p>The time has come to venture forth into the vast and wondrous terrain of your soul. A place of shimmering potential that lies just beyond the reach of the everyday world. It's time to open yourself up to the magic and mystery of the universe, to feel its warmth and wonder, and to let its gentle currents wash over you.</p><p>In our workshops, we will journey deep into the heart of your being, where the secrets of your true self are waiting to be revealed. Like a bird soaring high above the clouds, we will rise above the noise and confusion of daily life to a place of pure clarity and insight.</p><p>There, in the stillness of your soul, you will discover the hidden reserves of strength and courage that lie within you. You will learn to embrace your fears and transform them into powerful tools for growth and self-discovery. You will connect with the deepest parts of yourself, unlocking your true potential and unleashing your creativity and passion.</p><p>Our workshops are not just about measurable results, but also about the intangible gifts that come with exploring the deepest parts of your soul. Like a soft breeze on a summer day, these gifts can't be measured or quantified, but they are no less real or valuable for that.</p><p>So if you're ready to take the leap and explore the hidden depths of your being, come join us on this journey of discovery. Let us help you unlock the secrets of your soul and unleash your true potential, and together, we'll create a world of wonder and magic that is beyond your wildest dreams.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" data-image-src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" loading="lazy"></span><p>So often, &quot;love&quot; is preached from churches, new age beliefs, and competative culture. This breeds people who think they are better than others because they think they have arrived at enlightment. I belive that it is not about competition. People are where they are on their path to god and to love. There is a song (from scripture) that says &gt; Where can I run from your love? If I climb to .... still I know you are here&quot; This points that we are alwasys in gods love. We can't NOT be in gods love. People babble about being ultimate live, but they are so fucking competative (i.e. judgemental) that I can tell they are not &quot;there&quot;. But because they think they are there, they are not able to see something that they say that they so desperately want. They think they have it. They are telling everyone they have it. But they whine that they are victems and don't have what they really want. I want to say this in a way that people can hear. I want them to experience gods love to open up to who they are, to make a difference, to transform (i.e. die and live again).</p><p>Here's a revised version of the message with more poetic elements:</p><p>Love is a word that is often tossed around in today's society, but what does it truly mean? Is it a destination to reach or a journey to embark upon? We are all at different stages in our personal quests for love, and it is not a competition. It's about embracing the present moment and acknowledging that we are always encompassed in the loving embrace of a higher power.</p><p>There's a beautiful scripture that reminds us, &quot;Where can I run from your love? If I climb to the highest heavens or go down to the depths of the sea, still I know you are here.&quot; This speaks to the unbreakable connection we share with the divine.</p><p>However, many of us get caught up in the competitive nature of society and believe we've achieved ultimate love. We may even preach to others that we've found the key, but in reality, we're blind to the truth. We think we have what we desperately crave, yet we're still left wanting more.</p><p>So how do we find that deeper connection to love and the divine? It starts with experiencing the love of God, which is always present within us. It's a transformational journey, one that requires us to die to our old ways and be reborn anew.</p><p>Our upcoming session is an opportunity to delve deeper into the mysteries of love and connect with that divine essence that lies within us. Through poetic and sensory experiences, we'll explore the power of love and how it can open us up to new levels of personal growth and transformation.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" data-image-src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" loading="lazy"></span><p>This gets beyond the philosophy. That is a thinking construct and framework. Most songs are about love. I believe that this is because people so desparately want love. Everyone wants it. But they don't know how to &quot;get&quot; it. I beieve that we are already in it, and that there is nothing to &quot;get&quot;. We just need to come from a place of knowing that and acting in alignment with that. I have lived like this for a long time and the experience of it has changed my life. And I want to share that with people. It saddens me that people so deeply want love, connection, spiritual experience, transcend ego. I see that people can do this and it changes their life, too. I have consciously honed my skills to live life in accordance with this. Most folks haven't. I don't want to be better than them, but since I have devoted my life to gaining this insight, practicing the tools, and walking the walk. And I have helped other people find their own truth for themselves. I want to use my life's experience to help them find their way. I don't want them to follow my way. I want them to follow their own way.</p><p>Love is a universal longing. We all yearn for it. It is the most sung-about topic in songs throughout the ages. It's because everyone wants to experience it. The thing is, love is already there. We are already in it, and there is nothing to get. We just need to become aware of it and live in alignment with it.</p><p>It has been my life's work to hone my skills to live in accordance with love. I want to share this with others so they can find their own truth, their own way. I am not here to be better than anyone else, but since I have devoted my life to finding and practicing these tools, I want to use my experience to help others find their way. I don't want them to follow my way; I want them to follow their own.</p><p>I know it can be disheartening to see so many people yearning for love, connection, and spiritual experience, but not knowing how to attain it. I've been there, and it is what drives me to share my experience and knowledge. I have seen the transformation that can occur when people find their own truth and align with love, and I want to help others experience that too.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" data-image-src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F350e32ed3f627219df102ad31ebe31d0%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fmi.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" loading="lazy"></span><p>I am looking for a central focus. Maybe &quot;LOVE&quot; is the focus. Other choices would be God, relationship with god, living in god's love, intimacy, belonging and connection. But people have so many preconceptions of &quot;god&quot; that it is difficult to use &quot;god&quot; as the &quot;marketing&quot; term. People do show up to workshops when I sell &quot;love&quot; workshops. They attend when I use those works. I want more attendees. I want them to get the love (and intimacy, belonging, and connection), but talking about &quot;god&quot; or &quot;psychic&quot; or &quot;mystic&quot; has so much baggage that it does not attract folks as much. What are other terms or phrases I could use to attract folks to get what they want?</p><p>Here are some other phrases and terms you could consider using to attract attendees:</p><ul><li><p>Heart-centered living</p></li><li><p>Authentic connection</p></li><li><p>Embracing vulnerability</p></li><li><p>Cultivating inner peace</p></li><li><p>Healing relationships</p></li><li><p>Inner transformation</p></li><li><p>Personal growth and development</p></li><li><p>Mindfulness and meditation</p></li><li><p>Gratitude and joy</p></li><li><p>Self-discovery and self-awareness</p></li><li><p>Conscious communication</p></li><li><p>Empathy and compassion</p></li><li><p>Creating meaningful connections</p></li></ul><p>Remember to focus on the benefits that attendees will receive rather than the features of the workshop.
