We were <em>probably</em> not the only Agile team in the LA area, but there weren't many - certainly not enough for a community (and we might have been first!). Our only source of knowledge was the original XP &quot;white book&quot; by Beck.Also, our team was under the gun. I only convinced the team to try XP after we had determined that all other options had failed. We had 0 code on our new product, it was Jan, and we needed a full running MMO game to show at E3 in May. We had 3 devs. If we didn't show the game, and get at least 2 signed letters of intent for people to use our engine, the board was going to shut the company down.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-URJ1UMGP9-g33007819ead-48" data-image-src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-URJ1UMGP9-g33007819ead-48" loading="lazy"></span><p><strong>Arlo Belshee</strong>  <a class="external-link" href="https://codebyrefactoring.slack.com/archives/CRG5YQFCG/p1662594003165679?thread_ts=1662584882.814679&amp;cid=CRG5YQFCG" rel="nofollow">3 months ago</a><br/>Thus, our other dev founder (we had 2 geeks and 1 suit) suggested that we do a rapid experimentation process on our process. He was an experimental physicist, so he meant with real data, baselines, and the rest. We started 1-week iterations (the norm at the time was 1 month with some 2-week) so that we could run enough experiments, designed our retro as the review of last week's data and the plan for next week's experiment, and got started.1</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/2277605381/2277638168.png" data-image-src="attachments/2277605381/2277638168.png" data-height="32" data-width="32" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="2277638168" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="1f64c@2x.png" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="2277605381" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="e9c1f4e3-85f2-49d9-bf84-9de372675fa5" data-media-type="file"></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-U032B92G337-a92051807877-48" data-image-src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-U032B92G337-a92051807877-48" loading="lazy"></span><p><strong>Jacqueline Lee</strong>  <a class="external-link" href="https://codebyrefactoring.slack.com/archives/CRG5YQFCG/p1662594156808269?thread_ts=1662584882.814679&amp;cid=CRG5YQFCG" rel="nofollow">3 months ago</a><br/>That's a really cool story</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-U032B92G337-a92051807877-48" data-image-src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/TR3CD5C0J-U032B92G337-a92051807877-48" loading="lazy"></span><p><strong>Jacqueline Lee</strong>  <a class="external-link" href="https://codebyrefactoring.slack.com/archives/CRG5YQFCG/p1662594217744409?thread_ts=1662584882.814679&amp;cid=CRG5YQFCG" rel="nofollow">3 months ago</a><br/>You say you wrote it for the agile conf... which one?

We also developed an extreme form of extreme programming.Remember, we didn't know what was normal. We just experimented and found what worked. We started with all of the practices, done as closely to the book as possible. No matter what we thought &quot;couldn't possibly work,&quot; we trusted the book and the experience it was based on.For the first 90 days, when something didn't work we assumed that the book was right and we didn't understand the context so were doing the wrong thing. Thus we re-read that section and then attempted to be more extreme, more precise, more rapid feedback, more like the few words we had to guide us. We kept trying stuff until we found what worked, and we assumed that was what the authors meant.After 90 days we had enough experience to assess when our context was different from Beck's (which wasn't very often), and so we also tried experiments less in-line with the text. That said, we probably ended up with 2-3 things that differed from the text...and a whole lot of things that turned out to be like the text, but more extreme.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/2277605381/2277638168.png" data-image-src="attachments/2277605381/2277638168.png" data-height="32" data-width="32" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="2277638168" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="1f64c@2x.png" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="2277605381" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="e9c1f4e3-85f2-49d9-bf84-9de372675fa5" data-media-type="file"></span><p><strong>Arlo Belshee</strong>  <a class="external-link" href="https://codebyrefactoring.slack.com/archives/CRG5YQFCG/p1662594344333179?thread_ts=1662584882.814679&amp;cid=CRG5YQFCG" rel="nofollow">3 months ago</a><br/>It was for Agile 2005.
