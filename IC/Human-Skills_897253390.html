Yet over and over again they found a significant percentage are able to overcome their life circumstances and achieve spectacular success. </p><p>How is it that individuals who are not “supposed” to succeed manage to overcome the odds? Are there certain traits that such people have in common? Can the rest of us learn from their success and apply it to our own lives? </p><p>In Succeeding When You’re Supposed to Fail, Rom Brafman, psychologist and coauthor of the bestselling book Sway, set out to answer these questions. In a riveting narrative that interweaves compelling stories from education, the military, and business and a wide range of groundbreaking new research, Brafman identifies the six hidden drivers behind unlikely success. Among them: </p><p>•The critical importance of the Limelight Effect—our ability to redirect the focus of our lives to the result of our own efforts, as opposed to external forces </p><p>•The value of a satellite in our lives—the remarkable way in which a consistent ally who accepts us unconditionally while still challenging us to be our best can make a huge difference </p><p>•The power of temperament—people who are able to tunnel through life’s obstacles have a surprisingly mild disposition; they don’t allow the bumps in the road to unsettle them</p><p>By understanding and incorporating these strat-egies in our own lives, Brafman argues, we can all be better prepared to overcome the inevitable obstacles we face, from setbacks at work to chall-enges in our personal lives.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups by Randall E.

Their brand-new two- or three-person start-ups are given a seemingly impossible challenge: to turn a raw idea into a viable business, fast. </p><p>Each YC session culminates in a demo day, when investors and venture capitalists flock to hear pitches from the new graduates. Any one of them might turn out to be the next Dropbox (class of 2007, now valued at $5 billion) or Airbnb (2009, $1.3 billion). </p><p>Randall Stross is the first journalist to have fly-on-the-wall access to Y Combinator. He tells the full story of how Paul Graham started this ultra exclusive institution, how it chooses among hundreds of aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs, and how it teaches them to go from concept to profitability in record time.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Quiet Influence The Introvert’s Guide to Making A Difference Kahnweiler, Jennifer B.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16056935-quiet-influence" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16056935-quiet-influence</a></p><p>Jennifer Kahnweiler proves introverts can be highly effective influencers when, instead of trying to act like extroverts, they use their natural strengths to make a difference. Kahnweiler identifies six unique strengths of introverts and &quot;includes a Quiet Influence Quotient (QIQ) quiz to measure how well you’re using these six strengths now. Then, through questions, tools, exercises, and powerful real-world examples, you will increase your mastery of these strengths.”</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Introvert’s Way Living A Quiet Life in A Noisy World Dembling, Sophia</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542909-the-introvert-s-way" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542909-the-introvert-s-way</a></p><p>&quot;Introversion Is a Gift.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.</p><p>In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.”</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway Jeffers, Susan J.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/653396.Feel_the_Fear_and_Do_It_Anyway" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/653396.Feel_the_Fear_and_Do_It_Anyway</a></p><p>“Dynamic and inspirational… filled with concrete techniques to turn passivity into assertiveness.

Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating &quot;blue oceans&quot;—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.”</p><p>&quot;Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

Integrity, honesty, dependability and the belief in an organization’s core values are showcased, along with the elements necessary to create a culture of excellence. A basic definition of leadership as the action of leading a group of people toward a common goal is the preface to the importance of creating a vision of the future—the true mark of a leader. Listening, teamwork, motivation and the ability to engage others in a cause are also presented as leadership qualities. Many modern-day or historical capsules of leadership bring to life the concept of developing the traits to become a leader.”</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Five Dysfunctions of A Team The Five Dysfunctions of A Team A Leadership Fable Lencioni, Patrick, 1965-</p><p><br/></p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team</a></p><p>&quot;Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive.

It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .</p><p>A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas.</p><p>A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.??</p><p>A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.??</p><p>A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers.</p><p><br/></p><p>This book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise &quot;wisdom of the crowd.&quot;</p><p><br/></p><p>Kawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.</p><p><br/></p><p>As Kawasaki writes, &quot;Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do.&quot; That's a big goal, but one that's possible for all of us.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Decide Work Smarter, Reduce your Stress, and Lead by Example McClatchy, Steve, </p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18227216-decide" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18227216-decide</a></p><p>How to make better decisions and achieve your goals What shapes a person's career and life, and defines them as a leader?

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.</p><p><br/></p><p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—&quot;not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.&quot; Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.</p><p><br/></p><p>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Move your DNA Move your DNA Bowman, Katy</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21988559-move-your-dna-restore-your-health-through-natural-movement" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21988559-move-your-dna-restore-your-health-through-natural-movement</a></p><p><br/></p><p>Move Your DNA explains the science behind our need for natural movement - right down to the cellular level.

Widely recognized as the classic in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorder–all are changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs. Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD.</p><p><br/></p><p>As Hallowell and Ratey point out, “attention deficit disorder” is a highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind. Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime. Inside you’ll discover</p><p><br/></p><ul><li><p>whether ADD runs in families</p></li><li><p>new diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations</p></li><li><p>the links between ADD and other conditions</p></li><li><p>how people with ADD can free up their inner talents and strengths</p></li><li><p>the new drugs and how they work, and why they’re not for everyone</p></li><li><p>exciting advances in nonpharmaceutical therapies, including changes in diet, exercise, and lifestyle</p></li><li><p>how to adapt the classic twelve-step program to treat ADD</p></li><li><p>sexual problems associated with ADD and how to resolve them</p></li><li><p>strategies for dealing with procrastination, clutter, and chronic forgetfulness</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>ADD is a trait, a way of living in the world. It only becomes a disorder when it impairs your life. Featuring gripping profiles of patients with ADD who have triumphed, Delivered from Distraction is a wise, loving guide to releasing the positive energy that all people with ADD hold inside. If you have ADD or care about someone who does, this is the book you must read.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>(maybe too woo woo)</p><p>A Mind of your Own The Truth About Depression and How Women Can Heal Their Bodies to Reclaim Their Lives Brogan, Kelly</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25817475-a-mind-of-your-own" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25817475-a-mind-of-your-own</a></p><p>Depression is not a disease. It is a symptom.</p><p><br/></p><p>Recent years have seen a shocking increase in antidepressant use the world over, with 1 in 4 women starting their day with medication. These drugs have steadily become the panacea for everything from grief, irritability, panic attacks, to insomnia, PMS, and stress. But the truth is, what women really need can’t be found at a pharmacy.</p><p><br/></p><p>According to Dr. Kelly Brogan, antidepressants not only overpromise and underdeliver, but their use may permanently disable the body’s self-healing potential. We need a new paradigm: The best way to heal the mind is to heal the whole body.</p><p><br/></p><p>In this groundbreaking, science-based and holistic approach, Dr. Brogan shatters the mythology conventional medicine has built around the causes and treatment of depression. Based on her expert interpretation of published medical findings, combined with years of experience from her clinical practice, Dr. Brogan illuminates the true cause of depression: it is not simply a chemical imbalance, but a lifestyle crisis that demands a reset. It is a signal that the interconnected systems in the body are out of balance – from blood sugar, to gut health, to thyroid function– and inflammation is at the root.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Mind of Your Own offers an achievable, step-by-step 30-day action plan—including powerful dietary interventions, targeted nutrient support, detoxification, sleep, and stress reframing techniques—women can use to heal their bodies, alleviate inflammation, and feel like themselves again without a single prescription.</p><p><br/></p><p>Bold, brave, and revolutionary, A Mind of Your Own takes readers on a journey of self-empowerment for radical transformation that goes far beyond symptom relief.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>To Process</p><p><br/></p><p>Creativity</p><p>Set the Container for your Creativity to FLOW</p><p><br/></p><p>Artist’s Way</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Secrets of Consulting</p><p>Gerald M Weinberg</p><p><br/></p><p>User Story Mapping</p><p>Jeff Patton</p><p><br/></p><p>A Pattern Language</p><p>Alexander Ishikawa &amp; Silverstein</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>12 Rules for Life </p><p>Jordan Peterson</p><p><br/></p><p>Reclaiming Virtue </p><p>John Bradshaw</p><p><br/></p><p>Coaching Agile Teams </p><p>Lyssa Adkins</p><p><br/></p><p>Stacking the Deck </p><p>David S Pottruck</p><p><br/></p><p>Extreme Ownership </p><p>Willing &amp; Babin</p><p><br/></p><p>Syncronicity</p><p>Joseph Jaworski</p><p><br/></p><p>Transform your Boundaries</p><p>Sarri Gilman</p><p><br/></p><p>No Joke</p><p>Jim Henderson</p><p><br/></p><p>How to be an Adult in Relationships</p><p>David Richo</p><p><br/></p><p>Integral Psychology</p><p>Ken Wilber</p><p><br/></p><p>The Four Agreements </p><p>Don Miguel Ruiz</p><p /><p><br/></p><p>Focus Framework </p><p>How to find product market fit </p><p>Justin Wilcox </p><p><br/></p><p>Aha! </p><p>10 ways to free your creative spirit and find your great ideas </p><p>Jordan Ayan </p><p><br/></p><p>Money Master the Game </p><p>7 simple steps to financial freedom </p><p>Tony Robbins </p><p><br/></p><p>Expert Secrets </p><p>The underground playbook to find your message, build a tribe, and change the world </p><p>Russell Brunson </p><p>Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World </p><p>A step-by-step guide for anyone with something to say or sell (audio book) </p><p>Michael Hyatt </p><p><br/></p><p>Time Management from the Inside Out </p><p>The foolproof system for taking control of your schedule – and your life </p><p>Julie Morgenstern </p><p><br/></p><p>Comfortable with Uncertainty </p><p>108 Teachings on cultivating fearlessness and compassion </p><p>Pema Chodron </p><p><br/></p><p>No Joke </p><p>When people like each other the rules change (video) </p><p>Brian Boyle &amp; Jim Hancock </p><p><br/></p><p>Running Lean </p><p>Iterate from Plan A to a plan that works </p><p>Ash Maurya </p><p><br/></p><p>Organizing from the Inside Out </p><p>The foolproof system for organizing your home, your office and your life </p><p>Julie Morgenstern </p><p><br/></p><p>The E Myth Revisited </p><p>Why most small businesses don't work and what to do about it </p><p>Michael E.
