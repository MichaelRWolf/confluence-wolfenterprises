These organizations tend to lag behind in innovation, discretionary effort, morale and ultimately performance.</p><p>The leaders who embrace an infinite mindset, in stark contrast, build stronger, more innovative, more inspiring organizations. Their people trust each other and their leaders. They have the resilience to thrive in an ever-changing world, while their competitors fall by the wayside. Ultimately, they are the ones who lead the rest of us into the future.</p><p>Simon now believes that the ability to adopt an infinite mindset is a prerequisite for any leader who aspires to leave their organization in better shape than they found it.<br/></p><p>Leaders Eat Last <br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last</a></p><p>&quot;How do you inspire deep trust and commitment to the company and one another? He cites the Marine Corps for having found a way to build a culture in which men and women are willing to risk their lives, because they know others would do the same for them. It’s not brainwashing; it’s actually based on the biology of how and when people are naturally at their best. If businesses could adopt this supportive mentality, employees would be more motivated to take bigger risks, because they’d know their colleagues and company would back them up, no matter what. Drawing on powerful and inspiring stories, Sinek shows how to sustain an organization’s WHY while continually adding people to the mix.”</p><p><br/></p><p>Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why?from_search=true" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why?from_search=true</a></p><p>&quot;In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way -- and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired.”</p><p>&quot;Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire.”<br/><br/><br/><a class="external-link" href="https://simonsinek.com/find-your-why/" rel="nofollow">Some resources to help find your WHY</a><br/></p><p>more on <br/><a href="1237549140.html" data-linked-resource-id="1237549140" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Purpose: WHY</a> </p><p /><p />
