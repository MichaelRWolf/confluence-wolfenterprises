TV has an intimacy, with them, they with us, utilize this!!</p><p>.<br/>Therefore, in Biz, a lot of things become possible in virtual speaking <br/>how can this happen?<br/>AECE</p><p><strong>Attendance</strong> - can handle many more, or however many </p><p><strong>Engagement</strong> - because more people, and accessibility of many online channels </p><ul><li><p>be ready, know tools and apply adult learning theory </p></li></ul><p><strong>Conversion</strong> - invite someone to invest with me <br/>because of intimacy and engagement, there is less distance, more immediacy in their connection and willingness to invest <br/>right NOW, show them the website, the stuff, ask them to send an email, whatever - get them in action with me Now - Immediacy <br/>always send people somewhere in and after an offering, even when only Content Delivery <br/>Recent Data says virtual speaker conversion is UP, right now </p><p><strong>Extension </strong>- spreading the word is easier - before and after presentation<br/>ask others to share, while they are still in the afterglow </p><p>Lever AECE in every offering </p><p>..<br/>Go for WOW!</p><p>Content is not all that is necessary for excellence<br/>Continue to deepen trust<strong><em> &quot;We are antidote to 'infocrap orgies”</em></strong><br/>(have something to say AND say it with pizazz)</p><p>Think of virtual speaking as if it is TV</p><p>Be attractive, be addictive: <br/><strong>ie Breaking Bad - never want to miss a minute, want to watch it twice, that’s a high bar!</strong></p><p>Think of my talk as <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://bedohaven.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BEDOHAVEN&amp;title=Story%20Arc%2F%20Grid%2C%20etc%20-%20Structure%20for%20books%2C%20talks%2C%20maybe%20even%20marketing&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=294925" rel="nofollow">https://bedohaven.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BEDOHAVEN&amp;title=Story%20Arc%2F%20Grid%2C%20etc%20-%20Structure%20for%20books%2C%20talks%2C%20maybe%20even%20marketing&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=294925</a> <br/>conscious about what to cover and create <br/>what tension to leave them with, when to resolve it </p><p>Vary tone<br/>Utilize space, quiet, and loud, dynamics<br/>props <br/>body language <br/>play videos <br/>co-host (klick and klack)</p><p>.<br/>Anything in person <br/>can adept online <br/>and <br/>how can I make it Better online than in-person??</p><p>.<br/>Exercise 1 - secretly a Copywriting segment<br/>what pisses me off?<br/>what is the grit in my client’s oyster? what pisses them off?<br/>what is their problem?<br/><strong>what is taboo? what can’t I say?</strong> - find it to full extreme - then figure out what/how I can address as much as possible - uncover it, then maybe dial it back</p><p>be <strong>specific and individualized </strong>as possible - that is where the Gold is</p><p>Make the offering and the Implementation both: <br/>eagle eye view - simple and actionable <br/>and<br/>also nuts and bolts - exactly what we do </p><p>.<br/>Exercise 2 - Unique Combos <br/>(WRW the way to creativity is constraints)</p><p>come up with three ideas. stories, foci<br/>then add 2 together<br/>what happens?</p><p>ie <br/>what do I offer? <br/>plus <br/>what do I love? <br/>how can these dance?</p><p>.<br/>Exercise 3 - add more sensory, to everything!</p><p>make virtual a more physical experience, move body, change positions </p><p>have them move, do things </p><p>ask them to bring in the smell of lemons, feeling of warm sun day </p><p>ask them to lay on ground and journal </p><p>ask them to look near, medium, and far </p><ul><li><p>rest eyes, put palms to eyes</p></li></ul><p>Zoom fatigue is happening <br/>so make it less like sitting on a chair, looking at a screen </p><p>..</p><p>Navigating Trends - powerful and necessary </p><p>Need to stay relevant </p><ul><li><p>so can speak to where they are, acknowledge realities of their life - otherwise can seem callous (ie COVID)</p></li><li><p>also If done well, makes our offering much more desirable &amp; relevant to them </p></li></ul><p>.<br/>Getting a paid speaking gig is like getting a new client, same general steps, difference is, if do it well many more followups tend to come from it <br/>It is all a lead conversion process - there is lead time needed </p><p>Good news, once have something that works, keep doing it </p><p>To find the right Stream:</p><p>Play with Keywords and what is trending</p><p>Google Research ie <br/></p><ul><li><p>who are speakers like me?</p></li><li><p>who are they, how do they do it, with whom are they doing it?</p></li><li><p>check out their speakers page &amp; their advertising </p></li><li><p>make a lead generation sheet from here </p></li><li><p>DO the same thing with Authors on Amazon </p></li><li><p>what were they doing before and what are they doing now?</p></li><li><p>Professional Organizations will be looking for speakers </p></li><li><p>Make a speaker one sheet: speaker info and topics I speak on, etc - random link: <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://speakerhub.com/blog/speaker-one-sheet-template" rel="nofollow">https://speakerhub.com/blog/speaker-one-sheet-template</a> </p></li></ul><p>.</p><p>Once get a reputation for crushing it, start to get momentum - there is a tipping point <br/>if I am good, do 5 great offerings and see what happens </p><p>Can always get a gig, if I generate it myself - easy to get exposure online: I’m Hired!</p><ul><li><p>can offer online - if 5 people respond online for a X I will do a 30 minute on X for you <br/>- Andrea’s client did this, got 4 to actually come, 2 people for a followup chat, 1 person bought a $2k package….</p></li><li><p>design your own show - add WOW</p></li><li><p>this time right now is a great equalizer - take advantage </p></li><li><p>opportunity to TEST, what are the words, needs, problems, desires of my people? Can just keep tweaking until it works. One step at a time, go up the stairs, smart risks</p></li></ul><p>.<br/>Tech &amp; Booby Traps </p><p>a little good tech goes a long way - light and sound </p><p>wow corporate clients with 2 camera shots </p><p>rehearse with the tech, ahead of time </p><p>.<br/>utilize crowdsourcing for answers and to engage audience - very interactive and engaging for folks <br/>(WRW - The (audio)book Art of Asking by Amanda Parker - she is a freaking genius at this - she was the first to utilize crowd funding in a Gigantic way)</p><p>.<br/>Start the way you want it to go <br/>if want them to engage, don’t wait - start with it, and keep doing it <br/>set the tone/inertia and keep it going </p><p>Rehearsal for Virtual </p><p>1 - do table read - break the ice </p><p>2 - helps to memorize the beginning and the end, so engaged with audience and gives a light lift, good impression - memorize one minute at a time and build form there </p><p>.<br/>set expectations before the event that their interaction is encouraged, so they are mentally prepared and dressed for it <img class="emoticon emoticon-wink" data-emoji-id="1f609" data-emoji-shortname=":wink:" data-emoji-fallback="😉" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="wink" alt="(wink)"/></p><p>ask them to take a moment to think, then ask them to share </p><p>encourage them that their engagement is valuable to me, to all, and to them </p><p>enthusiasm doesn’t mean crazy - can creat intensity, mystery, delight - textured experience - including silence - stay interesting without yelling <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" data-emoji-id="1f642" data-emoji-shortname=":slight_smile:" data-emoji-fallback="🙂" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="smile" alt="(smile)"/> </p><p>..<br/>Is there a commitment I am willing to make?</p><p>(WRW be bold enough to be me even more!<br/>and for current and coming content - make a structure which includes some of these distinctions)</p>
