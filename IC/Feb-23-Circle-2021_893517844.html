<br/>Or do we find ourselves wondering, <br/>“Sure, that person’s cute, but are they an axe murderer? <br/>Are they going to break my heart?”</p><p>Without safety, <br/>your best potential clients <br/>may never show up for the love and caring you have to offer.</p><p><strong>Marketing’s purpose is to create safety.</strong></p><p>Love is the province of the heart. <br/>Trying to manufacture love and attraction <br/>is what makes marketing sometimes feel “hypey” or contrived. <br/>Luckily, that’s not marketing’s job.</p><p>Marketing’s sole purpose is to help create safety for the ego, <br/>so that your best potential clients <br/>can slow down enough to pay attention and notice the love available. <br/>And, hopefully, feel safe enough <br/>to approach and receive the care you are offering them.</p><p>Safety is increased through<strong> Validation </strong>- of past present and future <br/><strong>VALIDATION</strong>-<strong>Empathy, VALIDATION-Identity and VALIDATION-Hope.</strong></p><p>It’s hard to feel safe if you don’t feel seen. <br/><strong>VALIDATION</strong>-<strong>Empathy</strong>, where they’ve been<br/>where you let people know <br/>you understand and appreciate their struggles and pain, <br/>is a key point.</p><p><strong>VALIDATION-Identity</strong> where they are<br/>is another fundamental piece of safety. <br/>Your clients want to know that you know who they are<br/>– what they care about, <br/>- what their lives are like, <br/>- who they are.</p><p><strong>VALIDATION-HOPE </strong>where they could be - what is possible for them.<br/>Mark’s spiritual teacher says “Hope is the most important medicine.” <br/><br/><br/>When hope combines with VALIDATION and IDENTITY, <br/>the safety increases, <br/>for the right people to approach you for care.<br/><br/>.<br/>.</p><p><strong>Urgency is a wake-up call. </strong><br/><strong>Hype is a fear-generating tactic </strong>used to manipulate a decision.</p><p>Spiritual teachers of all kinds use urgency to wake their students up to who they are. <br/>Mark’s sheikh will yell during a 3 a.m. spiritual retreat. <br/>Zen masters thwack students on the back with bamboo.</p><p>It’s okay to wake people up with strong language and urgency. <br/>You aren’t being manipulative, because they really want the help.</p><p>However, you cross the line into hype <br/>when you continue to push fear and urgency after the initial “thwack” <br/>causing them to decide to see you purely out of panic, <br/>instead of from the trust they feel in their heart.</p><p /><p>.<br/></p><p><strong><u>The Second Journey </u></strong><br/><u>when that prospector spends time in direct relationship with your business, </u><br/><u>most commonly through a regular mailing, emailing, or blog. </u><br/><u>This builds trust and relationship with them, until they become a customer or client.</u></p><p /><p>It can take time to create safety with people who need to see you. <br/>Trust and deepening intimacy with the people who will come to you <br/>is built through ongoing contact with potential clients. <br/><br/>This Second Journey of Marketing happens through a <br/>newsletter, blog, and other mediums of communication.</p><p><strong>Being generous with what you know.</strong></p><p>In your communications, be generous with what you know. <br/>Don’t worry about giving away too much. <br/>If they can heal themselves simply through your writing, then thank goodness! <br/>They probably didn’t need help anyway.</p><p>The people who need you will get incrementally helped through your generosity, <br/>and will come to you for more.</p><p><strong>Being friendly, personal, vulnerable and consistent.</strong></p><p>Only being the expert can create distance. <br/>Remember, people want to feel seen. <br/><br/>So bring a friendly, personal, vulnerable voice to your communications. <br/>It’s just a conversation with a friend, <br/>where you are sharing your wisdom to help them.</p><p>And be consistent. <br/>Your clients want to know that you are there for them. <br/>Inconsistent communications may unconsciously breed a fear for them: <br/>“Are you really there for me? Or are you going to disappear when I need you most?”</p><p><strong>The constant invitation to the Sacred Moment of the sale.</strong><br/>(The Sacred Selling conversation happens somewhere in the middle of the Second Journey.)</p><p>It can feel like you are being pushy when, <br/>in every communication, you invite them to take the next step<br/>--coming for an appointment or consult of some sort. <br/><br/>It’s okay. <br/>The people who aren’t ready will just ignore the invitation, <br/>and it will be okay with them because of your generosity and vulnerability.</p><p>The people who are ready for you sometimes need that invitation. <br/>It’s surprising, really, but people wonder whether you want them. <br/>A direct invitation invites them in: <br/>“Please call or email and we can chat for 15-20 minutes about your situation, <br/>and you’ll get my recommendations on how I could help you.”</p><p><strong>Blog, email, post, video, audio, hard copy? Depends on your audience.</strong></p><p>Your communications need to be in the language of your audience. <br/>It helps to get clarity about who you are helping, <br/>so you can know if they are on Twitter or use RSS, <br/>or if they barely ever turn a computer on.</p><p>There is no correct answer <br/>except the one that helps you connect with your best potential clients, <br/>whoever they are. <br/>If you know who they are, you can figure out how best to connect with them.</p><p /><p>.<br/></p><p><strong><u>The Third Journey </u></strong><br/><u>when they’ve had an ecstatic experience as a customer, </u><br/><u>and so become a raving fan. </u></p><p><u>These raving fans become active referral sources, </u><br/><u>sending people they know or meet,  into your First Journey.</u></p><p><br/><br/><strong>The First and Third Journeys</strong><br/></p><p><strong>The First Journey</strong> is that initial contact you make with someone new, <br/>however it hap- pens. <br/>And the First Journey, hopefully, ends with someone joining your Second Journey communication list.</p><p><strong>The Third Journey</strong> is when your best raving fan clients <br/>refer folks they know into your First and Second Journeys, <br/>helping you to reach more of the people who need you.</p><p><strong>The First Journey is not a sale, it’s just an invite to the Second Journey.</strong></p><p>Don’t mistake that initial contact for a night club proposition. <br/>One big mistake often made is when you meet someone who expresses interest, <br/>maybe strong interest, in what you do, <br/>and you start wondering if they should or could be a client. <br/>And then you invite them to come in, and they don’t.</p><p>Their interest may be geniune, <br/>but they may not be ready for that Sacred Moment of the sale <br/>that happens during the Second Journey. <br/><br/>Instead, invite them into the Second Journey <br/>by offering them an article on the topic they are struggling with, when they sign up on your list.</p><p>Once they are on your list, <br/>they’ll probably come in sooner or later, <br/>when the timing is right.</p><p>The tragedy is that many initial marketing contacts are effective to some degree, <br/>but without a Second Journey, people drift away. <br/><br/>When the timing is right, they go to someone else, <br/>because they’ve lost track of you.</p><p>Unless they are on your Second Journey list.<br/></p><p><strong>The Third Journey educates clients to use your Second Journey.</strong></p><p>Your clients may be making referrals left and right,<br/> and yet no one is showing up. <br/>Why not? <br/>For all the reasons clients don’t show up in the first place <br/>– a lack of safety.</p><p>By sending potential clients to your Second Journey, <br/>urging them to join your mailing list and receive your articles, <br/>you are also educating them on how to make referrals to you.</p><p>This is such a low-pressure, low-commitment step for people to take. <br/>And if your communications to them are useful and helpful, <br/>it can be very satisfying for a client to pass on an article that directly helps a friend of theirs.</p><p><strong>Patience is a virtue</strong>. </p><p>The Three Journeys of Marketing can seem like it slows things down, <br/>but what it really does is match the real-world pace of how most people move. <br/><br/>Some people can jump in quickly, <br/>and some people may take a year or longer before they find their way in. <br/>With the Three Journeys in effect, you won’t lose those people.</p><p>However, it is true that personal, live, human contact can move things along more quickly. <br/>When you are just starting up, or struggling right now, <br/>you can meet people and have them jump into being clients relatively quickly. <br/>This can fill in gaps.</p><p>Ultimately, having all Three Journeys in place <br/>will move you out of the feast or famine cycle. <br/>Sustainably and generously being in connection with many people, <br/>while honoring each of their timing makes this possible.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Sacred Selling conversation happens in the middle of the Second Journey. <br/>“Sales” has acquired its bad name in part due to ignorance of this critical point. <br/>Unscrupulous or unknowing people who obey that cursed “three-foot rule” of sales, <br/>where you are supposed to talk to everyone within three feet of you, <br/>can create a stampede of movement away from your business.</p><p /><p>Ignorance of these three journeys can also cause some <br/>quite innocent pain and misun- derstanding. </p><p>You may think that interesting person you just met <br/>is actively interested in becoming a client. </p><p>She is definitely interested, <br/>but nowhere near ready to agree to anything. </p><p>Instead of nurturing her interest, <br/>you may push too fast, and lose her entirely.</p><p /><p>Frustrating, and unnecessary. <br/>She wanted to become your client, she just needed more time.</p><p>We are playing with <br/>any conversation you have around your business <br/>be more effective. </p><p>this material can also help your communication in your love life, <br/>because of the universal and spiritual heart teachings it’s based upon.</p><p /><p>Where your sales convo will really shine <br/>is when you have someone who already knows you, <br/>but hasn’t said “Yes.” </p><p>All of those maddening “interested” people who float around you, <br/>and never actually become clients.</p><p>We will work through this, and see that change.</p><p><br/></p>
