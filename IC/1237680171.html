At this particular threshold of our evolution, all kinds of people are asking themselves the same questions and holding the same concerns that you have. Much of it boils down to this: How do we work and prosper in harmony and integrity, while co-creating the socially and ecologically sustainable world we need? <br/>”</p><p>“Try not to be a person of success, but, rather, a person of value.” - Einstein</p><p>”<br/>as co-authors we join in one narrow place of certainty: that true leadership arises from within…</p><p>It’s not just the CEO who has the power to change an organization; we all influence people daily in ways of which we are barely aware. When we create changes within ourselves, they manifest as outer change, and when we take 100 percent responsibility for our inner climate, we develop immense leverage to change the outer climate…</p><p>I believe that the best leaders are those who not only “walk the talk” but who have also relinquished their own blocks to greatness within themselves. This requires taking on the arduous journey of moving beyond the limitations that most of us were conditioned to perceive in ourselves. Paradoxically, as we become freer to tap our deepest strengths, we come to peace with the places in ourselves where we often feel challenged. From that inner place of acceptance and humility we can best nourish the relationships that become conduits for a unifying force field that promotes a culture of respect, trust, and innovation. Self-knowledge is a theme of many contributors.  <br/>”</p>
