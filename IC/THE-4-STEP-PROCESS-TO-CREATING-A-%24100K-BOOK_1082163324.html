Trying many things, generally my opt-in costs have ranged from $4 to $12.</p></li></ul><p>That's a pretty big range, yes.</p><p>But, don't get caught up in opt-in costs. Better to concern yourself with ROI...</p><p>In other words, if it takes me $12 to get an opt-in and $200 for someone to then book a session, and then on average it takes me 5 sessions to enroll someone into my coaching program (let's say it's $5K), I've invested $1000 in ads to sell a $5000 program. Well worth it. Make that trade all day, every day.</p><p>Conversely if you're getting opt-ins for your book at $5, but no one in the audience books a session or enrolls, well, it doesn't matter how cheap the opt-ins are, right? So look to the ROI.</p><ul><li><p>In this training I am showing you how to profit from giving your book away, but then again, I sold you Write Like This for a few bucks instead of giving it away. Why would I do that? Are those competing philosophies?</p></li></ul><p>In short, I am continually testing to see what works better.</p><p>To date, giving the book away and having a rock solid follow up and offer has been more profitable for me (though selling the book with upsells is showing quite a bit of promise). </p><p>Just wanted to cover those points.</p><p>Thanks - </p><p>Drew Rozell, Ph.D.</p><p /><p> </p><p />
