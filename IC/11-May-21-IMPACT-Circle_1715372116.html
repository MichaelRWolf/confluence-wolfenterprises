Sometimes. <br/>And sometimes we: you, me, your potential clients, just freak out. <br/>It might be the best choice ground &amp; center and use tools you have <br/>while things are going to shit, but most of us don’t.</p><p>So, your client is struggling in the ship of their life, <br/>some problem has slowed their desired progress to a crawl. <br/>And then you pop up like a jack-in-the-box: <br/><br/>“Here, you should get a session with me!” or “Try my widget!”</p><p>Your Widget Looks Like a Roadblock</p><p><em>Y</em>ou know your widget, or your session, isn’t a road block. <br/>You probably even know it helps them get to the meeting. <br/><br/>But if you take a good look at how you present what you are offering, <br/>you can see how it might look like a roadblock to your clients.</p><p>For you, it’s really easy to focus on what you do. <br/>After all, it’s what you love. <br/>For many people, it’s why they’re in business, <br/>because they’ve fallen in love with the process or widget they are offering, and they think it’s fantastic.</p><p>Unfortunately, even when you’re trying to explain the benefits of your offer, <br/>to your potential client it still looks suspiciously like something that might be <br/>diverting time, money and other resources <br/>away from helping them to actually arrive at their desired destination.</p><p>The answer? <br/>You want to really take the time to see their destination: <br/>where are they trying to arrive?<br/></p><p><strong>You Are a Map Maker</strong></p><p><em>T</em>he idea is to show that your session or widget is not a roadblock,<br/>but a pathway to their destination. <br/>They can walk on your offer, with you walking beside them, and arrive more easily and quickly. <br/><br/>So, you need to know their destination(s). <br/>Where do they want to arrive?</p><p>Ideally, you want to find the most concrete destination possible. <br/>For instance,<br/>who wants to go with me to Taos, NM?</p><p>That kind of concreteness in a destination helps you to craft your offer. <br/>The NM Department of Transportation knew where and how to build the roads, <br/>because there is such a clear starting point, and a clear point of arrival.</p><p>How do you know when your clients have reached their destination? <br/>More importantly, how do <em>they </em>know when they’ve reached their destination?<br/></p><p>The ideal is to be able to measure that arrival point in a way that goes beyond just an internal feeling of satisfaction in the client, <br/>but includes measurable results that anyone can verify. <br/><br/>For instance, for a family counselor: “A whole week without fighting with your kids.” <br/>Or, for a business: “Three months in a row when you can easily pay your bills and have money in the bank.”</p><p><em>How do you know when your clients have reached their destination? </em><br/><em>More importantly, how do they know when they’ve reached their destination?</em></p><p><br/><em><strong>Journey. Destination. Roadblock.</strong></em><br/></p><p>.<br/>Homework:</p><ul><li><p>what you said you would do </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>sitting with KISS Offer Possibilities </p></li></ul>
