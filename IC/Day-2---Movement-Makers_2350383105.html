potential places for your Soul to Stretch&rdquo;</p><p /><p>.</p><p>Thank you!<br />: ) W</p><p>.<br />.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />.<br />You can BELONG <br />- in Spiritual Community, <br />- in a great Practice Community of folks who are like you - and very different from you <br /><br />SOUL Tech - sink deeper in your soul, experiencing divine connection consistently - in a whole more palpable WAY<br /><br />what is their pain? around Conscious Connection &amp; Collaboration with God<br />&ldquo;Where is your Bridge with the Beloved, BLOCKED?<br />10 areas for your Consideration - potential places for your Soul to Stretch&rdquo;<br /><br />My Spiritual Practice addresses all these aspects, head on, of course, over time - Soul Transformation<br /><br />.<br />this is not a complete list - but it contains many common stumbling blocks<br />These very Blocks can eventually help us on our way <br />Where we trip is our Treasure, so DIG!<br />.<br />the categories are not so neat - these categories are just here to help us inquire - not an IS for you or ALL<br />Can experience one or more of these than at a time.<br />Can experience each of these, over the course of your life - I have!<br />.<br /><br /><u>Human </u><br /><br />1) emotions in the way<br />allowing emotional info to block spiritual connection<br />Emotional Disregulation, Grief, Loss, Sadness, Pain, Fear,  Worry, Despair, Hopelessness, shame, hate&hellip;<br /><br />2) <a class="external-link" href="http://intellect.in" rel="nofollow">intellect</a> in the way  BELIEVE<br />allowing intellectual info to block spiritual connection<br />Doubt Confusion in Relationship with God or Bible or Church to Church Community or &lsquo;Backsliding&rsquo;/getting free of religion that doesn&rsquo;t serve/ work-for you,  Deconstruction<br /><br />3)  deep body-mind patterning/ brokenness that trips us </p><p>allowing soul habits/ momentum OR patterns below everyday consciousness to block spiritual connection<br />Anxiety, depression, PTSD, Suicidal Ideation,<br />Addiction or constant Distraction, <br />checking out of body/ dissociation<br />Chronic Physical/ Mental/ Emotional Illness/ Injury/ Pain/ Fatigue <br />Continuing Abuse, Trauma, Desperation, Hiding - in the Closet, Resistance, punishment &amp; victim &amp; savior &amp; blame patterns<br /><br />4) Drug or Distraction - infinite ways to Check-out Avoid being Here, Now, With<br />here or elsewhere:<br />If we end-run these dark gifts, with drug or distraction or&hellip;<br />we may decrease the pain/ fear/ shame to bearable levels <br />but we may be stuck in the desert our whole life <br />- never have the impetus to get through to the promised land - we may not find what we are looking for <br />  <br /><u>Religious Dysfunction</u> (all these contain aspects of all the human stuff above)</p><p>5) have to hide from God and cover-up  BEHAVE<br />- because stuck in the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil <br />judgment and broken undermining lies &amp; intellectual beliefs and concepts of religious shame &amp; sin and not good enough and not worthy, and have to hide from god, cannot merged with belief and identity  - satan &amp; invalidation <br /><br />6) thrown to / trained to look outside instead of inside <br />to as well as to love, serve or please god<br />as well as to meet god or receive blessings of God, <br />and get what we need completely in phsycal, independently (like safety, belonging, comfort, power &amp; will, love&hellip; as well as physical needs) - <br /><br />7) inability to disambiguate God and our Rel with God from other experiences/influences<br />from religion/ church/ Scriptures &amp; stories about God/ spiritual leaders/ religious abuse/ hateful &amp; hurtful behavior of believers/ ethics/ social &amp; religious shoulds/ judgment/ horrible stories of a wrathful, torturing, unpredictable zeus-character/ politics/ the game we are in , in this reality (weather &amp; cycles of the year, floods &amp; volcanos, our brokenness &amp; death, etc) and the natural consequences of our own and others behavior <br /><br /><u>Soul Journey</u><br /><br />8) Dark Night </p><p>in a stage of soul development where Nothing WORKS! a time of going into the chrysalis to eventually come out a butterfly<br /><br />9) soul capacity is limited or blocked OR needs to learn or mature - needs to clear or expansion/upgrade or needs to discover inner pathways of HOW to Connect <br />never -on your own without group worship  - used to but now can&rsquo;t  - when you choose, it comes and goes like the clouds <br /><br /><br />10) Not Blocked per se - just need access to a MUCH Broader Bridge than most folks around you<br />You Deeply Desire MORE!!! deeper wider all encompassing union - want all the divine marriage and the blessings promised - absolutely Crazy for God - Wild about the Holy One!!<br /><br /><br /></p><p /><p class="media-group"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="attachments/2350383105/2350612481.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/2350383105/day%202%20movement%20maker%20challenge%20notes.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1693325550927&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="2350612481" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="2350383105" data-linked-resource-default-alias="day 2 movement maker challenge notes.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="1aa04241-af32-4229-bfc3-2c11b645b653" data-media-type="file"><img src="attachments/thumbnails/2350383105/2350612481" height="250"/></a></span></p><p /><p /><p>the NEW insight was to </p><ol start="1"><li><p>P) ROMISE</p></li></ol><p><strong>couple movement marketing and messaging </strong>(yes you are Right, get them on our side -

this is the POWER of Books - it is REAL, can hold it!  Give a book to people who come to my stuff - they see my name, my Brand EVERY DAY while it lies around the HOUSE - take Advantage of the Physical Realm <br />- <strong>has a Manifesto </strong>(bitch woman sent this as a poster) - get people to SPEAK, DECLARE over themselves  <br />- <strong>speaks to people AS the Identity</strong>   <br />- have them <strong>DO what they didn&rsquo;t know they could Do</strong>. this is why fire walkers (cheesy) breaking boards (lame) but it WORKS - create an Experience where you are DOing something new that you didn&rsquo;t think you could do - not trickery  - I PROVIDE invitation to a TRANSCENDENT Experience -that is usually not available upon Demand. Tell struggling kids they are invited to a Special class and their grades RISE - it isn&rsquo;t lying to them, they just Shift their IDENTITY!<br /><br />To be a movement Maker is to take a stand<br />on the Spiritual TRUTH vs what is True in this world  .<br /><br /></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/2350383105/2350874631.png" data-image-src="attachments/2350383105/2350874631.png" data-height="575" data-width="542" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="2350874631" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 1.23.16 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="2350383105" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="39c8f3c4-7ab0-476e-9847-bde77679fce9" data-media-type="file" /></span><p><br /></p><p><strong>the problem unlocks the profit </strong><br /><br />don&rsquo;t have to chase people down - becasue they are enrolled by the STAND <br />HI I am Pedro and I believe this  - I stand in one place - Lighthouse - they can find me <br />be VOCAL and put a message in the Market place so they can hear and respond!<br /><br /><br />Jesus found his 12 <br />he prayed all night <br />walked around and saw them <br />he did not get one wrong - imo <br /><br />bigger is to let them find me <br /><br />lasting movements transcend the leader!!<br /><br /></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/2350383105/2350874637.png" data-image-src="attachments/2350383105/2350874637.png" data-height="575" data-width="542" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="2350874637" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 1.27.13 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="2350383105" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="4d9063ba-2e0f-4763-bd22-6e4f9f2805b3" data-media-type="file" /></span><p><br /></p><p>need a powerful story  -for Pedro <br /> - god tricked me story <br />- millions the hole story </p><p>Begin taking inventory of my stories <br />clues in to the process <br /><br /><strong>(Matthew 23? and asking and receiving for help0ing people enter worshiping the Move of Spirit and Jesus iwas too NARROW)</strong></p><p>.<br />Tools <br />Yesterday more clarity <br /><br />.<br />How do I take a STAND?<br /><br />every industry - lies being told to customers because of greed and corruption  - everyone is not a lier, but the majority <br /><strong>(it happens in church!
