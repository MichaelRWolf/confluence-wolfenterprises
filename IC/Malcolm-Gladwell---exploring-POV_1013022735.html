                    <p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.gladwellbooks.com/landing-page/malcolm-gladwell-books/" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell</a> - buoyant spirit, unflagging curiosity, brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.<br/>“Good writing,” Gladwell says, “does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else’s head.” <br/></p><p>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference 2000<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2612.The_Tipping_Point?from_search=true" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2612.The_Tipping_Point?from_search=true</a></p><p>&quot;The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate.”</p><p>&quot;Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.”<br/><br/><br/>Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking 2005<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink</a></p><p>&quot;Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.”</p><p>“Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of &quot;thin-slicing&quot; - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. <br/><br/><br/>Outliers: The Story of Success 2008<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers</a></p><p>”The biographies are generally told twice. The first time in a way that confirms all our prejudices about self made men and then in a way that makes sense of the success in ways we may find much more uncomfortable.”</p><p>&quot;The lessons of this book can be put into a brief sentence: success depends on a series of cultural and other factors that are mostly beyond your control – however, the thing that is totally within your control about success is how much effort you put in. And the more effort you put in the more likely you will be successful. They are directly proportional and we should all praise work as the key thing that really makes us human.”<br/><br/><br/>What the Dog Saw And Other Adventures 2009<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6516450-what-the-dog-saw-and-other-adventures" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6516450-what-the-dog-saw-and-other-adventures</a><br/><br/>Malcolm Gladwell focuses on “minor geniuses” and idiosyncratic behavior to illuminate the ways all of us organize experience in this “delightful” (Bloomberg News) collection of writings from The New Yorker.</p><p>What is the difference between choking and panicking? Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?</p><p>In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.<br/><br/>Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the “dog whisperer” who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and “hindsight bias” and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.<br/><br/><br/>David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants 2013<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15751404-david-and-goliath" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15751404-david-and-goliath</a></p><p>&quot;Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong, the small can match up against the giant, and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business, sports, culture, cutting-edge psychology, and an array of unforgettable characters around the world, David and Goliath is in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.”<br/><br/><br/>Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know 2019<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers</a></p><p>How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn’t true?</p><p>Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath…</p><p>Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don’t know. And because we don’t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
