What can you see beyond their destination?<br/></p></li></ol><p><br/>BBBB</p><p>As you map out the journey towards your clients’ destination,<br/>keep in mind these four things:<br/>(1) Results that the client wants;<br/>(2) Satisfaction for the client in working with your offer;<br/>(3) Repeat business so they keep journeying with you;<br/>(4) Referrals to other clients who need to travel to the same destination.<br/></p><p>CCCCC<br/>HOW can I be more specific?  <br/>– the more measurable the destination is, the easier the offer will sell itself<br/>– it’s the same with the deliverables.</p><p /><p>DDDD<br/>The Four Types of Deliverables<br/>There are generally four types of deliverables for a service business.<br/>If your offer is a product, these four are possibilities in addition to the main product that is being sold.</p><ol><li><p>SeSSionS</p></li><li><p>Written</p></li><li><p>CreatiVe</p></li><li><p>StrategiC allianCeS for CreatiVe DeliVerables</p></li></ol><p><br/>EXTRA </p><p>David shared<br/>Redbubble and Springtee</p><p>My upcoming workshop series <br/><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://wendyrwolf.com/july-2021/" rel="nofollow">https://wendyrwolf.com/july-2021/</a> <br/><br/><br/><br/>LLL<br/>NOTES I led teaching meditation from <br/><br/></p><p>Sacred Selling</p><p>…<br/></p><p>Beginning to Craft the Offer</p><p><em>Y</em>ou can see the destination they are trying to reach, <br/>and you know the problems they are running into trying to reach that destination. </p><p /><p>And you can also see the further point you’d love them to get to. <br/>Now it’s time to map out the pathway there that is going to be your offer.</p><p>As you map out the journey towards your clients’ destination, <br/>keep in mind these four things:</p><p><strong>(1) Results </strong>that the client wants; <br/><strong>(2) Satisfaction </strong>for the client in working with your offer; <br/><strong>(3) Repeat </strong>business so they keep journeying with you; <br/><strong>(4) Referrals </strong>to other clients who need to travel to the same destination.</p><p>The first two represent an important distinction: <br/>the difference between results and satisfaction. </p><p>Results are obvious: your clients want to reach their destinations. <br/>It’s important that as you begin to craft your offer, <br/>you think about how your offer will help them achieve the results they want.</p><p>However, client satisfaction is equally important, <br/>and distinctly different than results. </p><p>The most obvious example of the difference between the two <br/>has to do with studies done on medical malpractice cases. <br/>In these studies, they’ve found that technical skill as a doctor <br/>is not an indication of whether a malpractice suit happens or not<br/>– it’s whether the client has a good relationship with the doctor.</p><p>In cases where doctors spent little time connecting with patients and getting to know them, <br/>but simply went in and did their jobs, <br/>the malpractice rate was higher. </p><p>However, for doctors who took time to be friendly with their patients, <br/>what is commonly called a “good bedside manner,” <br/>the rate of being sued for malpractice was significantly lower.</p><p>You can help your clients reach their destination, <br/>but if you don’t help to make the journey enjoyable for them in some way, <br/>if you don’t have a “delight” factor in what you offer, <br/>you may not have happy clients, despite the results they get.</p><p>On the other hand, <br/>if you delight your clients, <br/>but miss on the results, <br/>you may not get complaints, <br/>but you won’t be able to build a strong business.<br/>.</p><p>As for the other two, repeat business and referrals, <br/>keep those on the back burner. <br/>We’re going to get to them near the end of this section.</p><p>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Okay, Let’s Get Down to Brass Tacks: Deliverables</p><p><em>A </em>deliverable is a piece of your offer that you deliver. <br/>For instance “6 sessions over 12 weeks” is a deliverable. <br/>“A 20-page workbook” is a deliverable. </p><p>Picking the deliverables of your offer is where the creativity and “making it up” part comes in. <br/>Whether it’s a service or a product, you are an inventor, <br/>and you get to put together the different parts of your offer.</p><p>Just as I emphasized the concrete nature of the destination <br/>– the more measurable the destination is, the easier the offer will sell itself<br/>– it’s the same with the deliverables. <br/><strong>(exercise - ASK &amp; Receive)</strong></p><p /><p>The presence of the deliverables is what makes your offer an “offer.” <br/>The fact that you show up and do something, or give them something <em>is </em>the offer.</p><p>I know I made a big deal earlier about the destination, <br/>and how your clients aren’t buying your widget. <br/>And that’s true—they are trying to get to their destination.</p><p>Have you ever seen stepping stones in a garden? <br/>The right stepping stones just invite you to step on them. <br/>They look solid, they’re beautiful, and they lead you towards the promise of something beautiful, <br/>perhaps a secret nook in the garden behind that bush. <br/>They hold the promise of leading you somewhere special.</p><p>The deliverables in your offer are like stepping stones <br/>on the garden path to their destination. </p><p>If the garden is dug up and messy, <br/>then stepping stones are mighty attractive. <br/>If the stepping stones look good, and solid, <br/>and are placed close enough to make stepping from one to another easy, <br/>then people are going to want to just stroll through the garden with you, on your stepping stones.</p><p>Okay, so let’s talk about those stepping stones.<br/></p><p><strong>The Four Types of Deliverables</strong></p><p><em>T</em>here are generally four types of deliverables for a service business. <br/>If your offer is a product, these four are possibilities in addition to the main product that is being sold.</p><p><strong>SeSSionS</strong></p><p>A session is when you spend your personal time with clients. <br/>It could be one-to-one individual sessions. <br/>It could be in a class situation where you are teaching or working with many people.</p><p>An example could be individual coaching or healing sessions as a practitioner. <br/>Another example could be a series of six 90-minute classes you are teaching on a particular topic.</p><p>In the case of a product, example <br/>go to Audio store <br/>bought a bunch of audio equipment <br/>guy said: “If you have any trouble with the software, <br/>you can just come in with your laptop, and I’ll give you a tutorial, <br/>as long as the store isn’t too busy.”</p><p>We took him up on that, and got about 40 minutes of his time during a quiet time of the day. <br/>That’s a great deliverable.</p><p>People have many different ways they learn. </p><p>If you can provide recordings to support your client, <br/>that gives them a substantial stepping stone towards their destination. </p><p>You can provide the recording of the actual sessions or classes you teach, <br/>or you may have a different class you taught that would be helpful. </p><p>For some businesses, a visual demonstration or learning tutorial <br/>for a product or method can be really powerful. <br/>Also music (as long as it’s original, or royalty-free), <br/>or a guided meditation, can help support someone.</p><p>Remember, it’s not just about results, but also about satisfaction.</p><p>You can deliver this information either by CD or DVD or mp3 file or private video on YouTube<br/></p><p><strong>Written</strong></p><p>Books, booklets, workbooks, and handouts are all powerful additions to your offer. <br/>You’ll be surprised at how much material you can come up with. </p><p>Mark:<br/>My 300+ page first book started out as a single-page handout <br/>when a client asked me to write up an exercise we did together. <br/>I eventually expanded that single worksheet into a few pages of explanation, <br/>and repeated that process with a few other exercises.</p><p>It didn’t take long before I had a bona fide workbook. <br/>And then I had five of them, totalling about 100 pages of material. <br/>Some writing and editing to make them truly a stand-alone product, <br/>and voila: a 300+ page book. <br/>Crazy.</p><p>So, don’t get overwhelmed trying to write an entire book. <br/>Start small, with a single handout, or a few pages of written support for your clients. <br/>It can make a world of difference.</p><p>Audio guy gave us a hands-on tutorial for our audio software, which was great. <br/>But imagine if he took the most commonly asked questions of his clients and created his own Donny’s</p><p>What kind of written materials could your clients use?<br/></p><p><strong>CreatiVe</strong></p><p>Break all the boundaries here. <br/>Especially in service businesses, <br/>it’s easy to overlook a whole world full of delights that are waiting for you, and your clients. <br/>If you sell products, you may have the opposite problem—hiding behind your product, and not thinking that you and your presence are important. So the previous three deliverables would’ve been your challenge.</p><p>In either case, coming up with creative bonuses and add-ons that add delight, satisfaction and results can really flip the wig of your clients, and help to make your offer very attractive.</p><p>For instance, how about a massage therapist that includes bath salts to help move the toxins out and soothe your body after your massage?</p><p>There’s a place I go for massages here in Portland called Roots Whole Body. Included with every massage is access to a beautiful bathroom/shower area, as well as a dry sauna. Plus, the whole place is just gorgeous.</p><p>Another organizational client who does spiritual trainings has a product they sell, which includes a booklet, a CD with guided meditations, and a set of prayer beads. Now, there are a lot of spiritual instruction sets out there, but how many of them come with your very own prayer beads? They are useful, to the point, and... delightful.</p><p>You may not have the resources to turn your office into a day spa, but what creative things can you add to your product that would add both to the results your client achieves, and the satisfaction they feel?</p><p /><p><strong>StrategiC allianCeS for CreatiVe DeliVerableS</strong></p><p>I couldn’t let this pass without special notice. If you are looking for a creative something to give as part of your package, see if you can find a strategic alliance. For instance, if you are that massage therapist, can you find someone in your town who produces hand-made soaps or bath salts? Would they be willing to provide a sample-size of their products at no cost, or maybe at their cost in exchange for including their marketing materials with the product?</p><p>One strategic alliance we did was with a holistic directory. We set up an arrangement whereby their advertisers received a free online marketing class from Heart of Business as a bonus. Their advertisers get an extra deliverable to help them in their journey to increase their business, the directory gets to give them something valuable that costs nothing to provide, and we get to make connection with folks who can benefit from our services. It’s a triple-win.</p><p>Don’t be shy about these, you can create something really special if it makes sense for your clients.</p><p>Only Include What Your Heart Shows You</p><p><em>T</em>hose are a lot of options for deliverables, and some of them are mighty tempting. Who wouldn’t want to produce a fancy DVD?</p><p>However, just because an option looks good, doesn’t mean you have to provide it. At least not now, and maybe never. Stay in your heart, and start simple. You can add as you go. Instead of a full forty-page workbook, two to three pages of handouts might do just as well for now.</p><p><br/><strong>(exercise - ASK &amp; Receive)</strong><br/></p><p>The Four Types of Deliverables</p><ol><li><p>SeSSionS</p></li><li><p>Written</p></li><li><p>CreatiVe</p></li><li><p>StrategiC allianCeS for CreatiVe DeliVerables</p></li></ol><p />
