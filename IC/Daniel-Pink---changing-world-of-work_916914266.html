Pink. Told in manga—the Japanese comic book format that’s an international sensation—it’s the fully illustrated story of a young Everyman just out of college who lands his first job.”</p><p>&quot;The Adventures of Johnny Bunko is a quick, fun valuable guide to thinking about career choices and how to find work that is fulfilling and meaningful… Pink does a great job of taking deep, complicated concepts, and making them pithy and accessible. With lessons like “It's not about you&quot; and &quot;Make excellent mistakes&quot; </p><p /><p><strong>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</strong> </p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive</a></p><p>Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people—at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.</p><p>Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:</p><p>*<strong>Autonomy</strong>—the desire to direct our own lives</p><p>*<strong>Mastery</strong>—the urge to get better and better at something that matters</p><p>*<strong>Purpose</strong>—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves<br/></p><p>Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.</p><p>Drive is bursting with big ideas—the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.<br/></p><p><strong>To Sell Is Human The Surprising Truth About Moving Others</strong></p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593553-to-sell-is-human" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593553-to-sell-is-human</a></p><p>&quot;Whether we’re employees pitching colleagues on a new idea, entrepreneurs enticing funders to invest, or parents and teachers cajoling children to study, we spend our days trying to move others. Like it or not, we’re all in sales now.</p><p>To Sell Is Human offers a fresh look at the art and science of selling.… He reveals the new ABCs of moving others (it's no longer &quot;Always Be Closing&quot;), explains why extraverts don't make the best salespeople, and shows how giving people an &quot;off-ramp&quot; for their actions can matter more than actually changing their minds.</p><p>Along the way, Pink describes the six successors to the elevator pitch, the three rules for understanding another's perspective, the five frames that can make your message clearer and more persuasive, and much more. The result is a perceptive and practical book--one that will change how you see the world and transform what you do at work, at school, and at home.”</p><p /><p><strong>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing </strong></p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35412097-when" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35412097-when</a></p><p>&quot;Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don’t know much about timing itself… Timing, it’s often assumed, is an art. In When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, Pink shows that timing is really a science.”</p><p>“Readers will close the book with several ideas about how to make better, happier use of each day’s hours.&quot;</p><p>“Fabulous tips on how to increase productivity by making subtle changes to your work routine.&quot;</p>
