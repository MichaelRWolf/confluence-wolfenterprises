Truly <strong>Nourishing</strong> Yourself<br/>when we are nourished </p><ul><li><p>we brim with confidence </p></li><li><p>we access guidance</p></li><li><p>life goes more smoothy</p></li></ul><p>3 types needed -</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Body-personality (basic body needs, nervous system, ego) - “self care” <br/>- exercise, play, touch, sexuality, rest, sleep, R&amp;R <br/>without this we can’t connect to our soul<br/>with this, we become available for others</p></li><li><p>Social Needs - varies with introvert/ extrovert<br/>if too low, can be acting out of balance - easy to lose focus and service <br/>unhealthy to go to clients to get needs met </p></li><li><p>Soul - spiritual practice, mediation, connection with spirit, nature, soul-healing &amp; care<br/>if missing despair or striving can come in, With it - we are BEing LOVE, Shining LIGHT</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>** Trauma - most of us have it, most of us live on top of it, can we step-by step heal?<br/></p><p>All of these needs are legitimate <br/>This all takes time to do it, takes time to implement strategies to live all this, with ease.<br/>When we are Nourished, it practices efficiency and productivity - from here, our work flows<br/></p></li></ol><p>3. Compassionate <strong>Accountability </strong></p><p>small steps over time - IS THE WAY <br/>forward progress, it isn’t a straight line </p><p>pedaling a bike creates momentum <br/>meanwhile, blind attachment for our theory of forward movement, doesn’t serve<br/>single minded goal/progress without alignment in soul causes trouble in our body, soul, life, world </p><p><u>4 parts to Compassionate Accountability </u><br/><br/>1 - <strong>Clarify Vision</strong> - Clear but not too precise where you want to go and results you want  - from everyday and soul consciousness. When you are clear on your goals, and what you are hoping those goals will provide for you, then you can make clear commitments. </p><p>2 - Regular <strong>Review</strong> - path curves and not always aimed quite right, so review to course-correct  - therefore take small steps. Pick a structure for regular review (you can ask Ryan to review your work weekly.  You can even create daily check-in with others if you want.)<br/>Accountability happens when you take the time to look backwards, and compare what you did with what you had committed to do. <br/>It’s as simple as that. <br/>Included in this is less frequent review of big goals, strategic vision, and why you’re doing the whole thing in the first place.</p><p>3 - <strong>Discernment</strong>: Look for the full picture. Understanding what happened &amp; didn’t happen</p><ul><li><p>was scope bigger than I thought? unreasonable commitment?  priorities shifted? personal issue?  </p></li></ul><p>Pause and look more deeply each time you miss a commitment, to see what’s really needed.</p><p>4 - Keep it <strong>Fresh</strong> - Shake it up - Dance your goals and actions, not trudge. <br/>Neuroscience says: we are programmed to pay attention to change and newness - It’s a survival trait, that keeps us scanning our environment for threats.  Too routine becomes less important, make it new again. </p><p><br/><br/><strong>Homework:</strong><br/><br/>1&gt; Please stay in cadence with</p><ul><li><p>leaning into trades with others, </p></li><li><p>keeping up with Trello, and especially Slack - I am posting important stuff there</p></li><li><p>exploring resources in Confluence…<br/></p></li></ul><p>2&gt; Biz Dev:</p><ul><li><p>What stage of business are you currently in, and why?</p></li><li><p>what is your next priority?</p></li><li><p>how do you feel about this?</p></li><li><p>is acceptance of what IS, available?</p></li><li><p>what do I want to do and when?</p></li></ul><p><br/>More H/W, as you choose - its a long break:</p><ul><li><p>Sketch out a work schedule, knowing you can shift it </p></li><li><p>In each of three needs: Body-personality, Social Needs &amp; Soul? <br/>1) How am I already nourishing?<br/>2) What ways are working? feel nourished <br/>3) What is missing?  not feeling nourished <br/>~~where is greatest need? what commitment would serve most? Schedule, knowing you can shift it</p></li><li><p>Find a process for identifying your vision, and of what you are wanting for yourself and your business over the next period of time. Also, find a buddy to help you work that process.</p></li><li><p>Pick a structure to review your commitments. </p></li><li><p>What process are you going to use to understand what happened with your commitments? </p></li><li><p>Set a time on Calendar - at least once a quarter - to change cadence or look and feel, etc. </p></li></ul><p /><p /><p />
