Then, when those 90 seconds are up, he shows how to master the people-to-people skills that are essential to an ongoing business relationship. A new chapter added just for the paperback serves as a communication primer—drawing on his years in advertising, Boothman reveals how to make your message stand out and stick in a world that's already glutted with information.”<br/></p><p>The Irresistible Power of StorySpeak - How to Use The Most Powerful Language in the World to Inspire Individuals and Motivate Millions </p><p><a class="external-link" href="http://nicholasboothman.com/storyspeak/" rel="nofollow">http://nicholasboothman.com/storyspeak/</a></p><p>&quot;Intelligence is overrated. “Genius Communicators” earn more, out-perform, do better in school and college, get hired and promoted faster and get better service in person, and over the phone.”</p><p><br/></p>
