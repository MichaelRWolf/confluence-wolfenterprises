Yes.

Destination. Roadblock.</strong></em></p><p><em>These are points of clarity in your client’s life that leads them to do healing work.</em><br/></p><p>Journey. Destination. Roadblock. <br/>These are points of clarity in your client’s life that<strong> leads them to do healing work. </strong><br/>Don’t mistake the <strong>mystical inner healing journey </strong><br/>with the <strong>context for the journey</strong>, <br/>which are the external situations, goals, and destinations in one’s life.</p><p>But I also want you to be okay starting with vagueness.</p><p><strong>Starting with Vagueness</strong></p><p><em>F</em>or many of your clients, the most clearly they can articulate their destination is: <br/>“I want it to work.” <br/>That’s fine if you’re talking about a car, but it’s easier to be vague when</p><p>you’re discussing a business or a relationship.</p><p><br/>As I urge you into picking destinations, <br/>I also want you to make space to start with vagueness. </p><p>What if it was okay to be vague? <br/>When I started my business, I started by selling single sessions, too.<br/></p><p>What I don’t want you doing is living in vagueness. <br/>If you start in vagueness, <br/>I want you to bring an attitude of learning and exploration to your work with your clients</p><p><br/></p><p /><p><strong>The Starting Point: Making It Up</strong></p><p><em>H</em>ere’s another problem: if you are starting with vagueness, it doesn’t make for a very clear offer to your client. So you’re back at square one.</p><p>Guess what? You get to make it up. <br/>That’s right, ply your business paint brush, <br/>and just start splashing paint on the canvas, in a manner of speaking.</p><p>What I want you to do is to make your best, educated guess, <br/>based on what you already know about your clients <br/>and your area of expertise, and put it together.</p><p>Experiment:  <br/></p><p>Beyond the Mountain: One Last Bit About Destinations</p><p><em>Y</em>ou’re the expert. <br/>Your client may have their sights fixed on getting to Disneyworld, <br/>but as an expert, you know that there is much more beyond  Disneyworld.</p><p>That means you end up with two different destinations. <br/>There’s the destination the client wants for themselves, <br/>and then there’s the destination that you want for them. </p><p>This is a distinction worth seeing, <br/>because for many business owners, <br/>you know that the client is going to be much happier when they reach the further destination. </p><p>For instance, your client may want to have a week of not arguing with their spouse, <br/>but the destination you see is a relationship that truly inspires and nourishes both of them.</p><p>Your job is to show your clients that their destination and your destination for them <br/>are not different paths<br/>—but that your destination is simply a little further along the road than theirs. </p><p>What this might look like at first is to only acknowledge and focus on their destination. <br/>If you don’t include their destination in how you present your offer, <br/>they’ll believe you are forcing a choice on them: your destination or their destination.</p><p>Guess which one they’ll pick?</p><p>That’s right, they’ll leave you in the dust, <br/>and continue trying to get to their destination. <br/>Frustrating, watching them take off like that, isn’t it? <br/>Especially when you know you can save them time and energy.</p><p>You’ve got to make it clear for them that it’s one journey. <br/>Get clear on the second destination, <br/>the one you see for them beyond where they are trying to go. <br/>Then you can decide how and when it will work <br/>to begin to unveil this larger picture to your clients.</p><p /><p>Exercise | Choosing the Destination</p><p>Before getting to the details of your offer, first discover the destination.</p><p><strong>1</strong>. Take a moment to drop into soul focus. <br/>Let that deepen for a few breaths, and let go of concerns about “getting it right.”</p><p><strong>2</strong>. Picturing a particular client of yours, what destination are they trying to reach?<br/></p><p><strong>3</strong>. In their journey towards this destination, what problem(s) are they running into? <br/>What’s keeping them from reaching this destination?<br/></p><p><strong>4</strong>. Now ask in your heart to be shown, what is a further destination you want for them? What can you see beyond their destination?</p><p>Okay, so here are the destinations that will form the foundation of your offer. You now know where your client is trying to get to.</p><p><br/></p>
