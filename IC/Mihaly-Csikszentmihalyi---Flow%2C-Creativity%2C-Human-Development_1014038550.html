During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance.”<br/><br/>~</p><p>Creativity: The Psychology of Discovery and Invention</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2973685030_creativity" rel="nofollow">https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2973685030_creativity</a></p><p>“The classic study of the creative process from the bestselling author of Flow… Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process.”</p><p />
