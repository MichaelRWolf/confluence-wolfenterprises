Ideally, you just get to be yourself.</p><p>-you are killing creativity and flexibility in your business right from the get-go. <br/>What if you want to expand your skills or your roles? <br/>In adding a new label or process, are you really needing to create a whole new business? </p><p><br/>People are in need and really do want your help. <br/>But, they are so focused on their own challenges <br/>that they don’t have a lot of time and attention for you. <br/><br/>If you throw your label or process in front of them, <br/>you are a distraction, getting between them and their goal.</p><p>However, if you put your One Compelling Sentence in front of them, <br/>instead of standing between them and their goal, <br/>you are suddenly standing shoulder to shoulder with them, <br/>helping them to reach their goal. <br/><br/>They are going to be very interested in you.</p><p>Very compelling! <br/>And it can leave you feeling tender.<br/>Kinda Visible...</p><p>The tenderness arises when you let go of the safety in this statement: <br/>“I’m here to work with whoever asks me to help them.” <br/>In that statement you don’t risk rejection. <br/>You don’t risk anything, <br/>except not serving forks, because so few people see that your business is for them.</p><p>The shift from the reactive, “I’ll work with you if you ask,” <br/>to the proactive, <strong>“I’m here to help these people confronting this problem,” </strong><br/>is a remarkable, passionate, caring, powerful stance to take. <br/><br/>People will notice this. <br/>Actually, they’ll be more certain you are the one who really understands them and can help. <br/>Compelling, isn’t it? <br/>And tender.</p><p>They are Vulnerable to share with us, to say their challenge, to allow our help.<br/>It is useful to be tender and vulnerable ourselves.<br/><br/>That choice, once made, <br/>will bring you those wonderful things you’re yearning for: <br/>finding your clients, <br/>more powerful and compelling marketing, and <br/>successfully receiving referrals, <br/>as well as ease in creating offers, <br/>among other things.</p><p>And, of course, clarity and ease in answering the question <br/>“So... what do you do?” </p><p>We can’t help everyone. <br/><br/>Therefore, confronted with this question: <br/>who do you want to help? <br/>And who aren’t you here to help?</p><p>The humility required here is the trust that everyone and everything is in the hands of the Divine. <br/>That you are not the sole safety net for the universe. <br/><br/>This Means Fun<br/><br/>!!! The people you most enjoy working with are the people you are meant to serve.!!!<br/><br/>Who drinks up what you have and eagerly asks for more? <br/>Who are your best clients, who do you do your best work with?<br/></p><p>Permission and Surrender</p><p> “NO!” is what the Divine says to all that isn’t Truth.</p><p>Lets say NO to Who/What is not ours<br/>so can make room for bigger YES for  Who/What is </p><p /><p>Exercise</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Ask your heart: who is your business really here for? <br/>Who are you really here for? As you get any little bits of clarity, write it down. Breathe. Relax. Open.</p></li></ol><p>Note: This is NOT your One Compelling Sentence, or even marketing language of any sort. <br/>This is just for you. <br/>So ask, trust your soul, and see what comes. Say “Yes” to whatever comes.</p><p><br/></p><p>The surprisingly tender process of shifting from working with whoever shows up <br/>to planting your flag and saying “I’m here for these people!” <br/>is made easier simply through accepting your heart’s truth.</p><p>GO TALK - 2 people 10 minutes <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/></p><p><strong>The Problem: </strong><br/><strong>Any time someone is stuck and unable to progress with some task, project or goal.</strong></p><p><br/> The Simple Idea</p><p>Name what someone is struggling with and you have their full attention.</p><p>Whatever problem people face, <br/>wherever your best clients get stuck, <br/>it tends to take up all of their attention. <br/><br/>Giving them empathy for that problem, <br/>letting them know you see them there, <br/>is extremely compelling. <br/>You’ll have their full attention.</p><p /><p> The Teaching</p><p>Did you notice how these referrals happened? <br/>Somebody mentioned a problem. Fever and cough. Trouble communicating. Challenging teenager. <br/>These problems triggered an association for the listener, who made the referral without thinking about it.</p><p>Many people in business insist on marketing their solution, <br/>and try to become known for what they do. <br/>If you notice, neither of the referrals made any mention of how the problem would be solved. <br/>Just that the problem would be solved.</p><p>But hey, you might say, <br/>“I don’t want to be associated with a problem. I don’t want to focus on the negative.”</p><p>Surprisingly, associating with a problem <br/>can be a much more rewarding spiritual state than associating with a solution. <br/>One of our most basic needs is to feel seen, loved, appreciated, known, valued. <br/><br/>If I’m hurt, I need that hurt acknowledged and addressed <br/>before I have any space to hear about your solution.<br/><br/>PrOBlEM ExAMPlES:</p><p>HEAlTH</p><p>Struggling with cancer. chronic illness.</p><p>Tired all the time.

What problems do your clients struggle with</p></li></ol><p>that what you do helps in some fashion? <br/>Don’t edit it, don’t shorten it, don’t make it “realistic” or “marketing-ese.” <br/>Just list’em. <br/>As much as possible, use language that your clients would use to describe the problem. <br/>Think about what they’ve told you they want help with, or what they have complained about. <br/>Can you remember the exact words and phrases they’ve used?</p><p>Also, please don’t get too humble. <br/>While it’s true that no one can really fix anyone else, <br/>you can, and do, assist/support/help them with whatever they are struggling with. <br/>Own that. <br/>If you’re new, it’s okay. You still help. <br/>And, with time, you’ll help more.</p><p /><p>2. Look over your list and narrow it down, if necessary. <br/>Which Problems are relevant in particular to the work you do? <br/>You are looking either for <br/>1) a problem that captures the essence or overview of all the other particular problems, or <br/>2) a fundamental or foundational problem all your clients struggle with in some way, <br/>even though they have other problems you help, too. </p><p /><p>.</p><p> The Simple Idea Revisited</p><p>People are yearning to be witnessed, without judgement, in their struggles. <br/>Empathy is extremely compelling.</p><p>If you can name the problem someone is struggling with, in her own words, she’ll feel seen. <br/>And if she believes you “get” the struggle she’s having, <br/>she will also be more likely to believe that whatever solution you are proposing <br/>will actually help her get through the struggle.</p><p>10 minutes - 2 people <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>POWER of Particularity <br/>Screen door slams, mary’s dress waves…  <br/>lyrics- <a class="external-link" href="http://www.brucespringsteen.it/DB/sd3.aspx?sid=602" rel="nofollow">http://www.brucespringsteen.it/DB/sd3.aspx?sid=602</a><br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOqyQ3WH8yw" rel="nofollow">Thunder Road Bruce Springsteen [Full + Lyrics]</a><br/>so rich and specific, everyone can relate, find matching pictures <br/>tempting to go broad - please play this week in Going Deep and very specific </p><p>BE very Specific - Poetry is specific and we ALL get it <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Homework Reminder:<br/>please play in this arena:<br/><strong>HOW TO SAY WHAT YOU DO in one compelling sentence</strong><br/>“I help DEMOGRAPHIC who care about PSYCHOGRAPHIC who are struggling with THE PROBLEM.”<br/><br/>I help Soul-Centered, Budding Entrepreneurs, <br/>begin to OWN that they are in Business <br/>     (after avoiding the big, bad B-word all their lives)<br/>and it is accessible… maybe even FUN!<br/><br/></p>
