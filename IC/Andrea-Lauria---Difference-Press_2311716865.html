Learning these techniques could give you the unfair advantage you have been waiting for! </p><p>This book disrupts 375+ years of publishing history and shares what works now if you want to:</p><ul><li><p>Get your book noticed if you aren’t already famous</p></li><li><p>Make your book absolutely irresistible to any publisher</p></li><li><p>Write your own ticket for the future of your message</p></li><li><p>Guarantee your book will sell – even if you don’t have a list</p></li><li><p>Use your book to take your coaching business to the next level</p></li><li><p>Help potential clients find you so you can make a positive impact</p></li><li><p>Share your experience and expertise with the world<br/><br/></p></li></ul><p><strong>NOTES from Book:</strong><br/><br/>When you <strong>learn to regulate your river, you can change the world.</strong></p><p>1)<br/>The issue isn’t whether you are a good enough writer <br/>or even if you have a good enough idea. <br/>The issue is whether you can share your idea with a <strong>sexy enough hook</strong> <br/>so that non-marketing-oriented publishing professionals <br/>will know what to do with your book so that copies get sold.<br/></p><p>2)<br/><strong>Being the cool kid in the publishing world </strong>can’t be underrated.<br/>One of the top questions an agent or publisher is asking is: What will other people in the industry think? Will this raise or lower my status?<br/><br/>3)<br/>Attractive authors sell more books<br/>If you are unattractive, overweight, don’t dress well, are not well-spoken, won’t look good on TV, if you have a weird lisp or a lazy eye, you just aren’t media-genic enough for a publisher to take a risk on.<br/><br/>4)<br/>Are you going to be an<strong> annoying author to work with?</strong>  Can you follow instructions?<br/><br/>5)<br/>A small percentage (less than 6 percent) of your fans will buy your book. the<strong> bigger your platform</strong>, the more accurately a publisher can estimate book sales.</p><p>6)<br/><strong>Bandwidth </strong>- Saying yes to you means saying no to someone else. It’s a business based on placing bets strategically on which will win</p><p>.<br/></p><p>most publishers aren’t thinking about this stuff consciously </p><p>In order for publishers to “wake up” to the amazing potential you have as a leader in the self-development movement and literally beg you to be on their list you have to do four things:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>You have to shoot down or<strong> override the unconscious objections</strong> publishers have to seeing you as mainstream material.</p></li><li><p>You have to make publishers<strong> chase you and earn the right to be your publisher</strong>. You have to paint a picture for them of what it’s going to be like for them when you are their top-selling author.</p></li><li><p>You have to make them feel like<strong> you don’t need them, and that they are going to lose the chance to be your publisher </strong>if they don’t take action.</p></li><li><p>You have to make them feel like publishing you and investing the company’s resources in <strong>making you a star is their idea</strong>.</p></li></ol><p /><p>I am the TALENT <br/>“The prize never chases”<br/><br/>flip the switch that makes them hunt you down and offer you a contract</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Stop needing them to publish you.</p></li><li><p>Take control of your own intellectual property.</p></li><li><p>Make them compete for you (and refuse to compete for them). If you’re too easy to have, they are not going to want you.</p></li></ol><p>And then, if everything we’ve talked about in this book doesn’t light a fire under the publish- er’s ass to pick you, it’s time to go nuclear. And that means you publish yourself and formally let this idea go.</p><p /><p>Confident, powerful authors have a lot more op- tions in the elitist traditional publishing world than mousy, needy authors do. (And I promise, how good your ideas are and how good you are as a writer is only a tiny part of this!)</p><p /><p>.<br/>the agent will get 15 percent <br/>Here’s what would convince almost any agent it was worth their time to work with you – for free – on the hope that someday they will make money:</p><ul><li><p>You are famous – and by that, I mean you have 1,000,000 plus followers in social media or on your email list. You have a reality TV show or a major column in a national publication.</p></li><li><p>You have a big idea that has traction – you are the Queen of a Specific Mountain – you have actual, real achievements.</p></li><li><p>You have credentials so your agent won’t be embarrassed by you when she pitches you to a traditional publisher.</p></li><li><p>You are well-spoken and attractive.</p></li><li><p>You “get” the marketing game, have a history</p><p>of making investments that have paid off.</p></li><li><p>Table stakes: you are at least a good writer,</p><p>ideally a great one. If you aren’t, you know it</p><p>and are prepared to hire accordingly.</p></li><li><p>You are 0 percent entitled, whiny, or victimy.</p></li><li><p>You get what you are bringing to the table and</p><p>you know if this agent isn’t a fit, another one</p><p>will be.</p></li><li><p>You are 100 percent sure you are going to be</p><p>successful with or without this agent. <br/><br/>Notice how small a role your idea plays in this list. You know how in real estate they say it’s all about location, location, location. Well, for the world of literary agents, “location” is your platform – the number of people you reach.</p></li></ul><p /><p>The truth is, the world needs a lot more managers and coaches to help artists and healers bring their messages to the masses <br/>and it needs a lot fewer agents to capitalize on the hard work of the talent. <br/>The model is flipped because people have a weird relationship with money.<br/><br/>Here’s what I want you to remember from this chapter.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>You almost certainly need an agent to get a great publishing deal.</p></li><li><p>You only want to get an agent when you know it’s a slam dunk for them to make lots of money.</p></li></ol><p>Until you can be a slam dunk for an agent, you need to focus on becoming a slam dunk. If you need help with that, you get a manager and/or a coach.</p><p>Once you understand what’s your job, what’s<br/>an agent’s job, and when you need to bring an agent on your team, you can set yourself up to have publishers begging to publish your book</p><p>.<br/>we know between 1:7 and 1:10 books generate a profit for the publisher, and so they take a risk</p><p /><p>Here’s the question I want you to ask yourself very seriously:<br/>What would make it worth giving up 50 – 90 percent of your revenue to a publisher?<br/>I can think of four main categories and I’m going to discuss each and share<br/></p><p><strong>Myth One: A Publisher Will Pay for Me to Publish.</strong> <br/><strong>they will keep 90 percent of your salary for themselves!</strong></p><p>Let’s take a $14.95 trade paperback where the author as standard receives 7.5 percent retail. That translates to:<br/>$7.48 to the bookseller $5.83 to the publisher $0.95 to the author $0.17 to the agent</p><p>my vote is always for betting on yourself to win.</p><p>If this math is confusing, head over to www. <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="http://YouDontPayToPublish.com" rel="nofollow">http://YouDontPayToPublish.com</a>  for a free class with me where I’ll explain this all slower and with visual aids!<br/>Let’s agree that saving on upfront costs</p><p>to produce and market your book is not a good reason to go with a traditional publisher.</p><p>Let’s agree that saving on upfront costs</p><p>to produce and market your book is not a good reason to go with a traditional publisher.<br/></p><p><strong>Myth Two: A Publisher Will Get Me More Sales</strong><br/>Publishers do B2B marketing. Meaning they will sell your books INTO bookstores. It’s your job to find consumers to buy them and get them out of bookstores<br/>Seth Godin: “The bookstore as we know it is doomed”<br/>sales of print books on Amazon are outpacing bookstore sales 3:1.<br/><br/>your publisher will feature you in their sales catalog and on a website and they will pitch your book to book clubs and libraries. They might even do a press release that no one sees, but <strong>the truth is, this is not what’s really going to move the needle – you are</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Myth Three: A Publisher Will Provide Me an Established Professional Team</strong><br/>you need to ask yourself, <strong>who are these people working for? </strong>Remember, the trick is to follow the money. The publisher is fronting the costs for your book. Here are some of the services you get with a traditional publisher that you will have to pay for if you do it on your own (or learn how to do yourself ):</p><ul><li><p>book design (including cover design, layout and typography)</p></li><li><p>editing (several stages)</p></li><li><p>typesetting and proofreading (several stages)</p></li><li><p>cover brief and preparation of cover art (sev-</p><p>eral stages)</p></li><li><p>project management services to keep key</p><p>people up to date</p></li><li><p>cover copy, marketing copy, press release</p><p>copy</p></li><li><p>marketing plan</p></li><li><p>proof and printing</p></li></ul><p>I would estimate your publisher will spend at least $10,000 on you – maybe as little as $5,000 and as much as $20,000 depending on their overhead and company values. And that doesn’t include the fact that they had to front you an advance.</p><p>They are spending this because you are their product.</p><p>You don’t get a team when you work with a publisher. The publisher’s team gets you. You are just a pawn in the game. If you really want to protect and exploit your own rights you need a team that is 100 percent aligned behind you. Who is compensated to protect your goals – not their own.<br/><br/><strong>The Only Real Reason to Go with a Traditional Publisher Anymore</strong></p><p><strong>THE SNOB FACTOR </strong>None of them have to do with making money or making a difference. All of them have to do with having a seat at the big kids’ table and the value of that to you personally.</p><ul><li><p>A lot of national media outlets will ignore you without a traditional publisher.</p></li><li><p>You are highly unlikely to be able to sell TV, movie, or magazine rights without a tradi- tional publisher.</p></li><li><p>You will not be eligible for many/most literary prizes including the New York Times Bestseller list. (See Chapter Five for more on that).</p></li><li><p>If you are trying to get your own TV show – a traditional deal will help.</p></li><li><p>Should you be applying for an extraordinary person visa with the US government, a tradi- tional deal is the way to go.</p></li></ul><p>These are the types of things a traditional deal can get you.<br/></p><p><strong>The Prize Never Chases</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, if you still want a tradition- al publishing deal, then you need to know how to get them begging to work with you.<br/>This is how you get a traditional publishing deal. You stop wanting one. You stop needing one. You stop expecting a broken industry to save you like some messed-up fairy-tale Prince Charming.</p><p><strong>What do publishers care about? Two things: Prestige and selling books.</strong></p><p>You (yes, you) need to go sell at least 10,000 copies of your book but ideally 35,000 copies.<br/><br/>I’d rather see authors paying up front, owning their own intellectual property, and working with business managers (whom they pay) to make sure they fully exploit their own rights, instead of having publishers hold all the power.<br/><br/>The publisher will say “Hey We think we can sell 10,000 copies of your book and we are willing to pay you $1 a book so we’ll just give you that $10K now in exchange for the opportunity to exploit your intellectual property.”</p><p>you are supposed to feel blessed for the opportunity and not pay attention to the fact that any publisher who believes you will make $10,000 enough to pay it to you in advance also believes they will make $90,000 from your book.</p><p>Have you ever heard the term <strong>“The house never loses”</strong>?<br/><br/>As author-funded publishing has evolved through the democratization of publishing, so has another trend – the indies. Seth Godin and Gay Kawasaki have led the charge of the indies. Rather than pay to publish – these authors would do it themselves – they would become pub- lishers.<br/>.<br/><br/>Books are amazing tools – but no matter how slowly you read, when you finish reading a book on weight loss, you haven’t lost 100 lbs.<br/><br/>I believe, and my authors believe: Truly making a difference means working directly and intensely with the readers who most connected with your message until they get the ultimate result or dream come true with the help of the author.</p><p /><p>continue pg 89 <a class="external-link" href="https://theauthorincubator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MakeEmBegToPublishYourBook.pdf?inf_contact_key=9d918feb339d82f61a590646432e198dd18a532c4142cb79caf2b269de1401fa" rel="nofollow">https://theauthorincubator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MakeEmBegToPublishYourBook.pdf?inf_contact_key=9d918feb339d82f61a590646432e198dd18a532c4142cb79caf2b269de1401fa</a></p><p /><p /><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><strong>Make ‘Em Beg to Be Your Client!

On the following pages you will find a template for a book proposal. As I mentioned on the call, I’ll be working with a handful of people to help them knock out their book proposal in my Expert Book Blueprint program.</p><p>This offer is designed for people who are looking for a high-paying book contract with a traditional publisher and those who want to make sure if they publish a book without an advance that they write a very good book that will sell well. If you sign up within 24 hours of the training there is $500 Fast-Action Discount Code. Get it by using the Code: FAST. Here’s the link to join us: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.NewAuthorSignUp.com" rel="nofollow"><u>www.NewAuthorSignUp.com</u></a><u> </u><br/></p><p><br/><br/>In Expert Book Blueprint, we will complete this template together and you will have a proposal to pitch to traditional publishers for a major advance and clarity whether that’s the right way to go for you.<br/></p><ul><li><p>We’ll start with designing your <strong>GOLD STAR book idea</strong>, in a way that guarantees it will sell once we create it. We’ll work on your messaging and positioning points so you get the book (and the results) you’re after. Even if you have a few ideas or no clear ideas now, you can tap into my 30 years of experience and together we will nail your big, beautiful book idea.<br/></p></li><li><p>Next up we will talk through all your ideas and stories and using my crazy pattern matching autistic brain, we'll write out a <strong>book outline and chapter summaries</strong>, the heart of your proposal. Each chapter will have a title, a summary, and a list of topics you can write about when you sit down to write that chapter. Whether you are self-publishing and going for a traditional deal, you will need this to get you to the finished draft of your manuscript.</p></li></ul><p /><ul><li><p>We’ll take those chapter summaries and our work with your book idea and whoosh it into a <strong>super sexy book description</strong> right before your eyes. This goes front and center into a book proposal, but you can use this for your marketing purposes and talk about the book NOW, even before it’s written, to get speaking and coaching engagements.</p></li></ul><p /><ul><li><p>Next, we will figure out <strong>how this is going to get published</strong>. Notice we don’t start there. Why? Because we won’t even know until the point the best way for you to publish. I’ll walk you through 3 options — Traditional, Self-Publishing, or Indie Publishing.

Here’s the link to join us: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.NewAuthorSignUp.com" rel="nofollow"><u>www.NewAuthorSignUp.com</u></a><u> </u>If you sign up within 24 hours of the training there is $500 Fast-Action Discount Code.

We’ll work on your messaging and positioning points so you get the book (and the results) you’re after. Even if you have a few ideas or no clear ideas now, you can tap into my 30 years of experience and together we will nail your big, beautiful book idea.<br/></p><p>Next up we will talk through all your ideas and stories and using my crazy pattern matching autistic brain, we'll write out a <strong>book outline and chapter summaries</strong>, the heart of your proposal. Each chapter will have a title, a summary, and a list of topics you can write about when you sit down to write that chapter. Whether you are self-publishing and going for a traditional deal, you will need this to get you to the finished draft of your manuscript.</p><p>We’ll take those chapter summaries and our work with your book idea and whoosh it into a <strong>super sexy book description</strong> right before your eyes.

Notice we don’t start there. Why? Because we won’t even know until the point the best way for you to publish. I’ll walk you through 3 options — Traditional, Self-Publishing, or Indie Publishing. We’ll weigh the options and fight out which is for you. </p><p /><p>Finally, I’ll take my 12 years of experience with the Kolbe system, my 32 years of experience with Myers Briggs personality types, and my 29 years of helping authors get their books done, and I’ll use it to help you <strong>create the most ideal writing and editing schedule</strong> for you.</p><p /><p>Getting your book written, published, marketed, and sold will be a turning point in your professional growth. This is the chance to get yourself organized so you can stop getting distracted and get it done and dusted. You will leave with a finished book proposal, publishing plan, and marketing strategy.</p><p /><p>This is perfect for you if:</p><p>✅  If you are someone who likes to bang stuff out quickly.</p><p>✅  You are an early adopter and like getting a deal.</p><p>✅  You want to get your book done right away.</p><p /><p>I’m only taking a small number of people in the program because it requires a lot of my personal time and attention so I’ll close admissions when I have the right mix of people.
