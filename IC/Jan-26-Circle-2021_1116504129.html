Saturday Workshop AUDIO - t</u>his is more about dancing with Love <br/><br/>.</p><p><strong> How To Say What You Do In One Compelling Sentence</strong><br/><br/><strong> The Simple Idea</strong></p><p>The three elements make a surprisingly compelling sentence for your right clients.</p><p><em>Collect/ write yours now (if don’t know, make it up)</em><br/>The Demographic - <br/>the Psychographic - <br/>the Problem -</p><p>If you have more than one of any of them, that’s okay. <br/>List them Now - paper or computer <br/>This is just the beginning, so just dance with this.<br/><br/>Your three elements, the Demographic, the Psychographic, and The Problem. <br/>All put together into a sentence are an extraodinarily compelling combination, <br/>for all the reasons that each element is so compelling on its own.</p><p><br/><strong>The Teaching</strong></p><p>Finally,<strong> The formula for your One Compelling Sentence.</strong><br/><br/>Share and review:</p><p><strong> ***</strong><br/><strong>One Compelling Sentence - construct using those elements:</strong><br/><br/><strong>“I help DEMOGRAPHIC PSYCHOGRAPHIC people who struggle with THE PROBLEM.”</strong><br/><strong>or it could look like:</strong><br/><strong>“I help DEMOGRAPHIC who care about PSYCHOGRAPHIC who are struggling with THE PROBLEM.”</strong><br/><br/><strong>I help (support, equip, inspire) [Demographic] </strong><br/><strong>who want (care about, need, struggle with, desire, are committed-to) [Psychographic] </strong><br/><strong>Who STRUGGLE WITH (WANT, NEED, are tired of, who suffer from) [The Problem.]”</strong><br/><br/><strong>If you have more than one word/concept for Demographic, Psychographic, or Problem, write 3-5 different versions, and keep playing with it:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Example: </strong><br/><strong>Demographic: Older women. </strong><br/><strong>Psychographics: Fun/Play, authenticity and contribution, </strong><br/><strong>The Problem: “Have the blahs.”</strong></p><p><strong>- I help older women who love play who struggle with the blahs. </strong><br/><strong>- I help older women who want to make a contribution and who are tired of the blahs. </strong><br/><strong>- I help older women with the blahs who struggle to feel truly authentic. </strong><br/><strong>- I help older women who want to be their playful selves and yet feel stuck in the blahs.</strong></p><p><strong>***</strong><br/>Meditation:<br/><br/>“I help DEMOGRAPHIC PSYCHOGRAPHIC people who struggle with THE PROBLEM.”</p><p>It’s the truth of what you do. <br/>You help people. <br/>You help certain people with a certain problem. </p><p>When someone asks you what you do, you say, <br/>“I help these people with this problem.” </p><p>You can mix it up. <br/>You can change the order of the elements. <br/>You can get comfy with the sentence.</p><p>What’s really important is that you are extremely clear in your own mind and soul <br/>what those three elements are. </p><p>.<br/>When you are, <br/>you can say the sentence however you like <br/>and it won’t sound scripted, <br/>and it will be surprisingly effective.</p><p>It’s almost understated. <br/>But don’t be deceived, it is extraordinarily powerful.<br/><br/><br/>.</p><p><strong>Two Words You Want to Include</strong></p><p>There are two words to include in your sentence <br/>which make a subtle and powerful shift <br/>in the effectiveness of your sentence. <br/></p><p>Here they are: “Who want” <br/>(alternatives: “who need” or “who struggle with”). <br/></p><p>**<br/>Example for <strong>Two Words You Want to Include</strong> “Who want” <br/>(alternatives: “who need” or “who struggle with”):</p><p><strong>Instead of saying “I help women struggling with chronic illness get their life back,” </strong></p><p><strong>say, “I help women struggling with chronic illness who want to get their life back.”</strong></p><p>**<br/></p><p>Try this: say the first sentence out loud and notice what happens in your body &amp; soul.</p><p>Then try saying the second sentence out loud. Notice a difference?</p><p /><p>The first one has the subtle message of “This is what it is.” The “who want” </p><p>in the second sentence brings a subtle energetic invitation, opening, spaciousness.<br/><br/>In the first sentence you’re telling them what you’re going to do to/for these women. </p><p>The second sentence talks about the desires, the hopes, the goals of these women, </p><p>it keeps the focus entirely on them. </p><p><br/>This is THEIR PROBLEM, Their Creation, NOT Yours <br/>You CAN’t FIX it - you CAN Assist, IF they Choose </p><p><br/>ALSO</p><p>“Who want” preserves your integrity. <br/><br/>If you’re doing any kind of transformational work, <br/>you know it’s very hard, and not in integrity, <br/>to make some kinds of promises. <br/><br/>Without the “who want” you’re making a promise to “get their life back.” <br/>By saying “who want” you’re simply saying you help people who want to get their lives back, <br/>or whatever they are wanting. <br/><br/>You aren’t making an outrageous promise. <br/>It’s more believable, <br/>and you stay in integrity.</p><p /><p><strong>Don’t Talk About What You Do</strong></p><p>It is extremely, almost irresistibly tempting <br/>to slip some statement about what you do or how you do what you do <br/>into your One Compelling Sentence. Don’t do it!<br/></p><p>For instance, “I help women with chronic illness who really want a normal life again.” <br/>That’s a simple, powerful sentence. <br/>If you include “I use hypnotherapy to help…” <br/>you ruin the effect. <br/></p><p>Why?</p><p>Whatever you do, people have pictures or assumptions about it. <br/><br/>If you drop it in the beginning, <br/>instead of later in the conversation once you’re already engaged, <br/>they will be reacting to their previous experience or belief about whatever it is you do, <br/>not you yourself. <br/><br/>If they had a mediocre or bad experience with hypnotherapy, they’ll tune you out.<br/>it’s going to be easy to slip into talking about your process, method, approach. </p><p>Restrain yourself. Retrain yourself.</p><p>You can talk about how you help them later, after they start asking questions.<br/></p><p><strong> Exercise: Your One Compelling Sentence</strong><br/><br/><br/>Practice is what matters</p><ul><li><p>understating of the construct, </p></li><li><p>playing with it, </p></li><li><p>constantly iterating</p></li></ul><p>.<br/>the exact word choice will iterate.<br/><br/>as you get more honed-in: <br/>make sure each of three elements are <br/> - expressed clearly, succinctly <br/>- <strong>in language your clients use</strong> to describe themselves and their situation.<br/><br/></p><p>PRACTICE together<br/><br/>Just taking a breath, relaxing, speaking each one. Notice how it feels.</p><p>This is not the End, it is the beginning</p><p>We are gonna step-into it</p><p>Just do it  - talker and listener <br/>No coaching, not plussing - just practicing, being with our self, <br/>our focusing presence of another giving us attention <br/>assisting us with our intention and focus. </p><p>5 mi each</p><ul><li><p>2 minutes to say it all over and over </p></li><li><p>1-2 minutes for Validation &amp; some workshopping</p></li><li><p>1 minute to say your favorite over and over </p></li><li><p>Validation &amp; quick feedback</p></li></ul><p>Switch</p><p>15 minutes together then 5 break - be back in 20 min!</p><p>.<br/></p><p><strong>The Other Way To Say It, “You know how…”</strong></p><p>This second way is actually longer than a sentence, </p><p>it’s more like two or three sentences. </p><p /><p>But it has a very compelling story-like construction, </p><p>and it sounds very conversational, unscripted, and disarming.<br/></p><p /><p>It’s a very compelling story in two or three sentences. </p><p>And the “who want” also plays an important additional role in this version <br/><br/><br/><strong>***</strong></p><p><strong> Example: </strong></p><p><strong> the “You know how” construction goes like this:</strong></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>“You know how so many women in their thirties, forties or beyond </strong></p><p><strong>are struggling with chronic illnesses of all sorts? </strong></p><p><strong>And how dispiriting, exhausting it is for their lives to be consumed by their illness, </strong></p><p><strong>missing out on all the normal things they used to love to do? </strong></p><p><strong>I help women like this who really want to get their life back.”</strong></p><p><strong>***</strong><br/></p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/></p><p>And there you go! You’ve got Your One Compelling Sentence in two flavors. </p><p>Except... how do you know it works? How do you know it’s really IT?<br/></p><p>Keep playing this week, and practicing with folks</p><p /><p>Next week we will start to test it to make sure. </p><p>So for right now, relax.</p><p><br/>…<br/>Your One Compelling Sentence is </p><p>understated, unscripted, simple, flexible, conversational, and packs a wallop.<br/></p><p>Simply naming someone’s </p><p>demographic, psychographic and the problem they are struggling with </p><p>is incredibly powerful </p><p>without sounding strange, hypey or pretentiously clever. <br/></p><p>Practicing makes it sound normal coming out of your mouth </p><p>and easy to remember.</p>
