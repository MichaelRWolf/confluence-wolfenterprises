                    <p /><p>Leadership is for everyone! <br/>Seth Godin has a Ton of Great Books - here is one that is relevant:</p><p>Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us <a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828382-tribes" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828382-tribes</a></p><p>“leaders come in surprising packages… (All you need) is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead. Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow(s)… It’s not easy, but it’s easier than you think.”</p><p>&quot;there’s a vast shortage of leaders. We need you.</p><p>For the first time ever, everyone in an organization – not just the boss – is expected to lead.</p><p>The very structure of today’s workplace means that it’s easier than ever to change things and that individuals have more leverage than ever before.</p><p>The marketplace is rewarding organizations and individuals who change things and create remarkable products and services.</p><p>It’s engaging, thrilling, profitable, and fun.</p><p>Most of all, there is a tribe of fellow employees or customers or investors or believers or hobbyists or readers just waiting for you to connect them to one another and lead them where they want to go.</p><p>Leadership isn’t difficult, but you’ve been trained for years to avoid it. I want to help you realize that you already have all the skills you need to make a huge difference, and I want to sell you on doing it. The best thing is that you don’t need to wait until you’ve got exactly the right job or built the right organizations or moved up three rungs on the corporate ladder. You can start right now.”</p><p>read more here<br/><a class="external-link" href="http://watercoolernewsletter.com/tribes-we-need-you-to-lead-us/#.W1EMnX4nb6Y" rel="nofollow">http://watercoolernewsletter.com/tribes-we-need-you-to-lead-us/#.W1EMnX4nb6Y</a></p><p /><p>more in Business</p>
