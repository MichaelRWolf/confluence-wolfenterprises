They love the craft of their profession and some will even turn that passion into a business. But when you’re running the show, you suddenly have to take on all the other tasks of running a business – including sales. For many business owners, this is the most dreaded part of running the business. Many people fear rejection, failure or coming across too “salesy.” But without new clients, most businesses won’t last very long.</p><p>&quot;<br/>Michael Port calls out every business owner who has ever uttered the words, “I hate sales” with practical advice in his book, <em>Book Yourself Solid.</em> The approach that Port has developed for sales and marketing is almost more spiritual and mindset based than anything else. It starts with the belief that you have important work to do and that there are people whom you are <em>meant</em> to serve in the world. From there, once you find the right clients and provide them with outstanding service it is easier to build momentum and a community of loyal fans. But first, “You need to learn the skills necessary to promote your work and become the go-to person in your field before it’s too late”.<br/>&quot;<br/>-Summary written by: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/team/vanessa-chase/" rel="nofollow">Vanessa Chase </a>- more at <a class="external-link" href="https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/book-yourself-solid/" rel="nofollow">https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/book-yourself-solid/</a><br/><br/>~~~~~<br/><br/>2)<br/>”<br/>Recommendation</p><p>The owners and employees of small service companies often end up doing it all, providing the service or product, managing the office, and handling sales and marketing - often the entrepreneur’s least favorite chore. Now, you can learn to love it or at least to do it well with less pain. Author Michael Port cites many applicable marketing activities that you probably already know about, but he pulls them together in an organized manner supported by lists of questions and answers. He begins with the foundation of your business, including your motivation and area of specialization. Then he teaches you how to build credibility with clients. Next, he covers marketing and outreach, including tactics for promoting yourself. The book’s concepts are easy to grasp and implement, including advice for conquering online marketing. You may already be carrying out some of these strategies, but this book can take you to the next level. <em>getAbstract</em> recommends it to those who want new clients badly enough to make sales and marketing a regular part of their jobs for a few hours a week. If you are a new entrepreneur, this resource will help you learn the art of rainmaking.</p><h2 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-Take-Aways">Take-Aways</h2><ul><li><p>To build your service business, cut clients who drain you, so you can handle new ones who inspire you.</p></li><li><p>Get clients by becoming an authority, and by being likeable and trustworthy.</p></li><li><p>Build credibility with clients by providing high quality products or services, solid credentials, effective processes, reasonable rates and customer-focused service.</p></li><li><p>Know your target market and be able to explain the benefits of your services.</p></li><li><p>A strong sales process requires knowing your market and what it needs.

First, weed out any current clients who drain your energy and lead to more stress than enjoyment. It’s scary to release clients when you need money, but having a red velvet rope policy - like the bouncer at an exclusive club - leads to getting &quot;booked solid.&quot; This policy helps you enlist and focus on clients who spark your dynamism. Maybe you’ve heard parents tell kids to stop hanging around with troublemakers. When you hang out with the right clients and let go of energy drainers, the contagious sense of high energy you feel will spill over into your work.</p><blockquote><p><em>“If you’re a professional service provider, it’s ’Who knows what you know?’ and ’Do they like you?’ that’s important.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Create a velvet rope policy by identifying the traits that ideal clients should have. Focus on quality. Categorize your current clients into three groups: ideal, duds and everyone else. Review which clients you love working with and why. The clients in the ideal category will help you define your specific target market.</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-&quot;FindingaTargetMarket&quot;">&quot;Finding a Target Market&quot;</h3><p>Having a defined audience makes it easier to locate clients who need what you offer. For instance, acupuncturists serve anyone in pain, but one acupuncturist narrowed his specialty to infertility. Rather than targeting everyone seeking pain relief, he focused on helping infertile couples. Once you build a strong client list in one specialty, you can add another target later. While trying to get clients in a profitable field sounds logical, it isn’t a good strategy unless you are also passionate about the work. When you’re not excited about your market, boredom sets in and drains away your energy. Get to know yourself. Identify the areas that excite you. Perhaps you can turn a hobby into a vocation. Forexample, someone who loves biking could integrate it into a business. A Web designer could build sites for bike shops, bike organizations and other biking resources; a doctor could specialize in athletes and a trainer could work with bikers.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Marketing and sales isn’t about trying to convince, coerce or manipulate people into buying your services. It’s about putting yourself out in front of, and offering your services to, those whom you are meant to serve - people who already need and are looking for your services.”</em></p></blockquote><p>After identifying your target market, determine its requirements and desires. This will tell you why these clients need your services and what they want. Then show people the reward they will receive for becoming your clients. Define their return. Clients &quot;technically&quot; buy acupuncture, Web site design or coaching, but they &quot;actually&quot; buy financial freedom, security and free time. These benefits are emotional and personal. If you can reach your target market by touching these chords, you will boost your ability to draw clients. Next, build a personal brand, which denotes your identity and your position in your market.</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-You,thePersonalBrand">You, the Personal Brand</h3><p>A personal brand covers who you are, what you do and why you do it. Your personal brand is based on which problems you solve and for whom, why people should come to you, and what results your solutions produce. Identify the factors that make you different or even eccentric. If you struggle with this question, ask your close friends and colleagues to identify your unique personality traits and talents. Then the next time someone asks, &quot;What do you do?&quot; you’ll have a meaningful answer. Instead of answering, &quot;I’m an architect&quot; you’ll be able to explain your special ability to help your target market. For the formula, just fill in the blanks:</p><ul><li><p>I know <u>__</u> (&quot;short summary of the target market&quot;) is concerned about <u>_</u>____ (&quot;the target market’s biggest problem&quot;). </p></li><li><p>&quot;What I do is <u>__</u> (how you solve the problems) and the result is <u>__</u> (big achievement).&quot;</p></li><li><p>The benefit of my work is <u>__</u>_ (explain).&quot; </p></li><li><p>To make the list shorter, you can say, I know <u>___ &quot;(the target market and its problem). What I do is _</u>__ (problem solved and benefits).&quot; </p></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>“Many service professionals...struggle to articulate - in a clear and compelling way - exactly what solutions and benefits they offer.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In one case, you could say: &quot;I know how many small business owners want more clients, but hate marketing and selling. What I do is teach people how to love marketing and selling, and get as many clients as they want.&quot; This approach explains the benefits of working with you and what kind of problems you solve. Use this methodology with everyone you meet, not just at networking meetings. Smile, be honest, be yourself, and your statement will sound natural.</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-EstablishingTrust">Establishing Trust </h3><p>Start building credibility by ensuring that you have the core requirements in place to make your target customer feel confident about working with you. The basics are:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;High-quality service&quot; - Clients will stay with you if you provide excellent service. </p></li><li><p>Good &quot;methods and tools&quot; - Customers expect you to have a good process in place. </p></li><li><p>Solid credentials - Qualifications and certification are most critical for service providers in specific roles such as doctors, lawyers and accountants. Some fields offer other credentials that clients seek, such as Microsoft certification for IT professionals and licenses for interior designers. </p></li><li><p>Demonstrate &quot;client importance&quot; - Treat each client as your only one. </p></li><li><p>Charge appropriate prices - Setting rates that are too low might undermine your credibility. Clients often think that they get what they pay for, so don’t be too cheap. </p></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>“If you’ve been feeling like you can’t, or shouldn’t, be paid to do what you love, you must let that limiting belief go if you’re to be booked solid.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you have these standard credibility builders in place, establish yourself as an expert in some facet of your field. Become an authority on that topic and be sure others know you have expertise. Keep your knowledge up-to-date by reading articles and a book each month in your area. Use your know-how to earn visibility, build confidence and get more clients.</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-SalesCycleProcess">Sales Cycle Process</h3><p>During the sales cycle, a prospect decides whether or not to buy from you. To ensure that your sales cycle process works, you must know your target market and what it needs. Be sure that your targets know where to find you, when to reach you, why they should select you and how to hire you. This step-by-step approach draws prospects in with a free offering, which encourages them next to buy an inexpensive product (thus creating some passive income for you), and gradually deepens their relationship with your business. Your goal is to give clients incentives and reasons to turn to your solutions more and more over time. To fulfill that objective, follow these steps in the sales cycle:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Meet prospects - Carry out some activity daily to meet potential clients.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Always have something to invite people to&quot; - Connect with potential clients by giving them risk-free samples. This relieves sales pressure, since you’re &quot;inviting&quot; the client to watch a free demo or download a free report. This establishes trust, boosts your reputation and introduces you to the prospect. </p></li><li><p>Follow up - Keep building trust by taking a step beyond the earlier freebie. Offer prospects an inexpensive but valuable product or service that they’re ready to buy.</p></li><li><p>Go beyond expectations - If, for instance, the client in step three bought a book, send the client an invitation to an event. If the client can’t attend, provide useful notes. Now, the client is deep into the sales cycle. Each step requires a bigger commitment.</p></li><li><p>Repeat as needed - Carry out step four again, with a higher-level product or service.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><em>“Most business problems are personal problems in disguise.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Vary the number of steps in your sales cycle depending on your situation. The point is to keep providing value to clients at each stage, so they can decide if you’re right for them. Make each offer more valuable than the previous offers. Never scare a client with a stage-five offer during stage one. Clients need to enter your sales cycle by doing the simplest thing that requires the least amount of investment. Ask yourself, &quot;How can I over-deliver and continue to serve this person or organization?&quot;</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-CreateaProductorProgram">Create a Product or Program</h3><p>The time you spend creating a promotional product or program is worthwhile if you use it to reach as many people as possible. For example, publishing an audio CD or posting an Internet download about your area of expertise establishes you as an authority and markets your business. If you make an audio available online, prospects can access it any time. They might decide to buy your product or service based just on your audio, so you could make sales without doing anything else. After all, you already put in your time when you created and published a top-notch audio or download.</p><h3 id="MichaelPort-BookYourselfSolid-SevenSelf-PromotionStrategies">Seven Self-Promotion Strategies</h3><p>To attract clients, spread the word about your expertise and abilities. Disseminate your message through as many different channels as possible. Solidify your foundation and your strategy for building trust and credibility before you implement any of these seven outreach strategies:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>&quot;Networking Strategy&quot; - Networking doesn’t necessarily mean making sales pitches, and racing to collect and hand out business cards. It is an opportunity to provide value to other people using the 50/50 approach - spend half of your networking time with potential clients and the rest with other professionals in your field.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Web Strategy&quot; - A Web site is a must-have to draw new clients. It demonstrates your expertise, represents your brand identity, lets you collect the names of potential clients and helps you connect with the right clients while sifting out people who don’t fit your target market. Your Web site should encourage visitors to act. Enable them to call, send an e-mail or enter contact information. Entice visitors to provide data by offering a free report, seminar or tutorial. Follow up every opportunity. If someone signs up for an online course, connect with the visitor before and after the class.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Writing Strategy&quot; - Build your expertise and credibility by submitting articles to e-mail newsletters, online &quot;e-zines&quot; and Web sites, as well as standard publications. If you find writing too stressful, hire a ghostwriter. Write about your passion for an area of your field. Tie your articles to your business. Give readers valuable information. If you publish online, include a short biography with a link to your Web site. Offer a resource box that prompts the reader to do something, such as join your mailing list, request more information or sign up for a free event.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Speaking/Demonstrating Strategy&quot; - Use the podium to get your message out and find the people you’re meant to serve. You aren’t limited to standing in front of an audience. Offer free teleclasses. Seek events where you can talk to as many people as possible. Pursue opportunities to conduct demonstrations, start clubs or hold monthly lunches to build your reputation as someone who helps people connect with each other. This builds trust and credibility.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Referral Strategy&quot; - Who gave you your last referral? What did the client need? What was the outcome? Use this information to determine why that approach worked so you can boost your referral traffic. Ask for more referrals. Try to get names and contact information so you can follow up.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Direct Outreach Strategy&quot; - The tools you can use to reach clients include letters, e-mails, calls, newsletters, postcards or press releases, as well any other creative tactics you devise. One person who had struggled to connect with a meeting planner sent a coconut with a note that said, &quot;You’re a tough nut to crack. How about it?&quot; Create an outreach plan that states who you will connect with, how and when. </p></li><li><p>&quot;Follow-Up Strategy&quot; - Maintain contact on a regular basis by using such tools as e-mail newsletters, printed newsletters, postcards or phone calls. E-mail newsletters provide a simple, low-cost way to give readers information while advertising your products and services. The 80/20 rule works here: a successful newsletter uses 80% of its space for content, and 20% for advertising and promotion.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><em>“Selling is based on pure emotion.”</em></p></blockquote><p>If you’re tempted to try all seven strategies, don’t. That’s a fast path to burnout. Start with two and work from there. Avoid getting overwhelmed. Save your energy for connecting with others. They eventually will become the people you serve.</p><p>“</p><ul><li><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.getabstract.com/en/summary/book-yourself-solid/6675" rel="nofollow">https://www.getabstract.com/en/summary/book-yourself-solid/6675</a> </p></li></ul><p><br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/><br/></p><p /><p /><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="876773406"><li data-inline-task-id="1"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks"><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="5eaae5bc9756e40b845fa2fe" href="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5eaae5bc9756e40b845fa2fe?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki">Gretchen Williams (Unlicensed)</a> in this interview, Michael Port is talking about a really interesting thing  -  <br/>collaborating with an artist in a business book.  she/they Re-Packaged a wildly popular book of his: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.learnoutloud.com/Audio-Books/Business/Sales-and-Marketing/Book-Yourself-Solid/28511" rel="nofollow">Book Yourself Solid</a>. <br/><br/>in this interview, you can hear minute 24 for a few minutes, til you wanna stop <a class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/XM6OMJM9brQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/XM6OMJM9brQ</a><br/><br/>There is a Huge Market here - SO many great books already available, could get a new life  <br/></span></li></ul><p>anyway -here is the book that came from this collaboration:  <a class="external-link" href="https://bysillustrated.com" rel="nofollow">https://bysillustrated.com</a><br/><br/>here are some (all?) of the illustrated worksheets - so great:<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/download/BYS-Illustrated-Worksheets.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/download/BYS-Illustrated-Worksheets.pdf</a><br/><br/>here are some videos about the book<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01wQK_4FCbNp9rzKmgHYkqaOEbu4w:1606343067208&amp;q=book+yourself+solid+illustrated+book&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiP2KGf3p7tAhXsRTABHd2jANgQ8ccDKAN6BAgFEAs" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01wQK_4FCbNp9rzKmgHYkqaOEbu4w:1606343067208&amp;q=book+yourself+solid+illustrated+book&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiP2KGf3p7tAhXsRTABHd2jANgQ8ccDKAN6BAgFEAs</a><br/><br/>About the illustrator and reformatter <br/>Port says:<br/>”When I met Jocelyn Walker, my co-author on <a class="external-link" href="http://www.bysillustrated.com/?utm_source=resources&amp;utm_medium=blogpost&amp;utm_campaign=bysillustrated" rel="nofollow"><em>Book Yourself Solid Illustrated</em></a>, she was <strong>“live-tooning”</strong> an event I attended.
