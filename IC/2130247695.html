Each new generation of parents seems to focus even more on creating possibilities for their children that they themselves never had. With the best of intentions, we hand our children off to a myriad of coaches and tutors to provide them with enriching experiences—thinking that will best prepare our kids for the future. But helping our children in this way can come at a high cost.</em></p><p><strong>The Greek Tragedy of Outsourcing</strong></p><p>Over the past two decades, Dell has been one of the world’s most successful PC manufacturers. Few people realize, however, that one of the reasons for Dell’s success was a Taiwanese component supplier by the name of Asus.</p><p>Dell hit its stride in the early 1990s—using several beacons to guide its growth. First, its business model was disruptive: it started making simple entry- level computers at very low costs, because they sold largely by mail or over the Web. It then moved up-market, making a sequence of higher-and higher- performing computers. Second, its products were modular—allowing its customers to customize their own computers by choosing what components they wanted in their machines. Dell would then assemble and ship them within forty- eight hours—an impressive achievement. And third, Dell tried to use its capital more and more efficiently, wringing more and more sales and profits per dollar of its assets—something Wall Street applauded. These three strategic beacons helped Dell succeed in quite an extraordinary way.</p><p>Interestingly, it was actually Taiwan-based Asus that enabled Dell to pull this off. Like Dell, Asus started at the low end providing simple, reliable circuits for Dell—at a lower price than what Dell could do itself.</p><p>In that context, Asus came to Dell with an interesting proposition: “We’ve done a good job making these little circuits for you. Let us supply the motherboards for your computers, too. Making motherboards isn’t <em>your </em>competence—it’s <em>ours</em>. And we can make them for a 20 percent lower cost.” The Dell analysts realized that not only could Asus do it cheaper but it would also allow Dell to erase all the motherboard-related manufacturing assets from its</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" alt="page88image4267960416" loading="lazy" src="attachments/2130247695/2130051093" data-image-src="attachments/2130247695/2130051093" data-height="10" data-width="25" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="2130051093" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="bfab8b93-37a0-41b8-b600-9d401b25f8b1" data-base-url="https://wolfenterprises.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="2130247695" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="35f1c67e-ac97-4039-91a5-4b7eaabd8b0a" data-media-type="file"></span><p>balance sheet.<br/>Wall Street analysts hawkishly monitor financial metrics and ratios that track</p><p>the “efficiency” of capital used in a business. One particularly common one is RONA, or Return on Net Assets. In manufacturing businesses, this is calculated by dividing a company’s income by its net assets. Hence, a company can be judged as being more profitable either by adding income to the numerator, or by reducing the assets in the denominator. Driving the numerator up is harder, because it entails selling more products. Driving the denominator down is often easier—because you can just opt to outsource. The higher the ratio, the more efficient a business is judged to be in using its capital. Asus’s proposal made sense. If Dell could outsource some of its assets but still be able to sell its customers the same products, then it would improve its RONA, making Wall Street happy. “Gosh, that would be a great idea,” Dell said to Asus. “You can produce our motherboards.” Funny enough, the agreement made Asus look better to investors, too; it was increasing its sales with the use of its existing assets. Both companies seemed better off.</p><p>After it had reorganized to accommodate this arrangement, Asus came to Dell and said, “We’ve done a good job fabricating these motherboards for you. Why don’t you let us assemble the whole computer for you, too? Assembling those products is not what’s made you successful. We can take all the remaining manufacturing assets off your balance sheet, and we can do it all for 20 percent less.”</p><p>The Dell analysts realized that this, too, was a win-win. As Asus took on the additional activity, Asus’s RONA increased as the numerator of the ratio— profits—got bigger. Shedding manufacturing processes also increased Dell’s RONA—it didn’t change the revenue line, but driving out those assets from its balance sheet improved the denominator of the ratio.</p><p>That process continued as Dell outsourced the management of its supply chain, and then the design of its computers themselves. Dell essentially outsourced everything inside its personal-computer business—everything except its brand—to Asus. Dell’s RONA became <em>very </em>high, as it had very few assets left in the consumer part of its business.</p><p>Then, in 2005, Asus announced the creation of its own brand of computers. In this Greek-tragedy tale, Asus had taken everything it had learned from Dell and applied it for itself. It started at the simplest of activities in the value chain, then, decision by decision, every time that Dell outsourced the next lowest- value-adding of the remaining activities in its business, Asus added a higher value-adding activity to its business.</p><p>All along, the numbers had looked good to Dell. But what the numbers had</p><p>not shown was the impact these decisions would have on Dell’s future. Dell started out as one of the most exciting computer companies around, but over the years, it has slowly outsourced its way to mediocrity in the consumer business. Dell doesn’t build those computers. It doesn’t ship those computers. It doesn’t service those computers. It simply allows companies in Taiwan to put the name “Dell” on the machines.</p><p>To be fair to Dell, it has successfully moved into the higher-profit server business, which is prospering. But on the consumer side, Dell outsourced something far more critical than it might have realized.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Capabilities</strong></p><p>You can tell from this story that there’s a danger to outsourcing. Clearly, if Dell’s leadership had known what the outcome would be from taking the approach they did, they would have been much more hesitant to accept Asus’s overtures. But how <em>could </em>they have known?</p><p>The answer lies in understanding the concept of “capabilities.” You need to understand what capabilities are, and which of them will be critical to the future, to know which capabilities are important to keep in-house and which matter less.</p><p>What do I mean by this?</p><p>When you boil it down, the factors that determine what a company can and cannot do—its capabilities—fall into one of three buckets: resources, processes, and priorities. These offer an accurate snapshot of a company at any given time, because they are mutually exclusive (a part of a business cannot fit into more than one of the categories) and are collectively exhaustive (together, the three categories account for everything inside of the business). Together, these capabilities are crucial in order to assess what a company can and, perhaps more important, cannot accomplish.</p><p>Capabilities are dynamic and built over time; no company starts out with its capabilities fully developed. The most tangible of the three factors is <em>resources</em>, which include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually people or things—they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or built. Many resources are visible and often are measurable, so managers can readily assess their value. Most people might think that resources are what make a business successful.</p><p>But resources are only one of three critical factors driving a business. Organizations create value as employees transform resources into products and</p><p>services of greater worth. The ways in which those employees interact, coordinate, communicate, and make decisions are known as <em>processes</em>. These enable the resources to solve more and more complicated problems.</p><p>Processes include the ways that products are developed and made, and the methods by which market research, budgeting, employee development, compensation, and resource allocation are accomplished. Unlike resources, which are often easily seen and measured, processes can’t be seen on a balance sheet.</p><p>If a company has strong processes in place, managers have flexibility about which employees they put on which assignments—because the process will work regardless of who performs it. Take, for example, consulting firm McKinsey, which is hired to help companies around the world. McKinsey’s processes are so pervasive that consultants from very different backgrounds and training can be “plugged” into the processes by which they habitually do their work—with confidence that they will deliver the needed results.</p><p>The third—and perhaps most significant—capability is an organization’s <em>priorities</em>. This set of factors defines how a company makes decisions; it can give clear guidance about what a company is likely to invest in, and what it will not. Employees at every level will make prioritization decisions—what they will focus on today, and what they’ll put at the bottom of their list.</p><p>Managers can’t be there to watch over every decision as a company gets bigger. That’s why the larger and more complex a company becomes, the more important it is for senior managers to ensure employees make, by themselves, prioritization decisions that are consistent with the strategic direction and the business model of the company. It means that successful senior executives need to spend a lot of time articulating clear, consistent priorities that are broadly understood throughout the organization. Over time, a company’s priorities must be in sync with how the company makes money, because employees <em>must </em>prioritize those things that support the company’s strategy, if the company is to survive. Otherwise the decisions they make will be in conflict with the foundation of the business.</p><p><strong>Never Outsource the Future</strong></p><p>Like Dell, companies in the pharmaceutical, automobile, oil, information technology, semiconductor, and many other industries have increasingly pursued outsourcing without considering the importance of future capabilities. They are encouraged to do this by financiers, consultants, and academics—they see how</p><p>quickly and easily they can reap the benefits of outsourcing, and don’t see the cost of losing the capabilities that they forgo in doing so. They risk creating their own version of Asus.</p><p>The history of outsourcing in the American semiconductor industry, for example, chronicles the woes that betide companies that blindly adhere to outsourcing. At the outset, it made all the sense in the world to outsource the simplest of the steps entailed in making semiconductor products to Chinese and Taiwanese suppliers. The American semiconductor companies thought they were safe, as they retained the more complex and profitable steps, such as product design.</p><p>But although the Asian suppliers started out by assembling only the simplest of products, they didn’t want to stay there. It was low-cost work, and almost anyone could do it. They knew that they would be vulnerable to losing that work to an even lower-cost assembler. So those Asian suppliers strove to keep moving up-market, fabricating and assembling ever more sophisticated products. Now the suppliers in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and China have become capable of making products and components that their American customers, who outsourced to these suppliers in the first place, could no longer hope to ever make.</p><p>The tables truly have turned. At the beginning, American companies outsourced simple things to drive costs down and get assets off their balance sheets. As is often the case, each of the decisions by themselves seemed to make sense. Now, however, they must outsource sophisticated products because they can no longer make them.</p><p>The theory of capabilities gives companies the framework to determine when outsourcing makes sense, and when it does not. There are two important considerations. First, you must take a <em>dynamic </em>view of your suppliers’ capabilities. Assume that they can and will change. You should not focus on what the suppliers are doing now, but, rather, focus on what they are striving to be able to do in the future. Second, and most critical of all: figure out what capabilities you will need to succeed in the future. These <em>must </em>stay in-house— otherwise, you are handing over the future of your business. Understanding the power and importance of capabilities can make the difference between a good CEO and a mediocre one.</p><p><strong>What Your Child Can and Cannot Do</strong></p><p>Whether we realize it or not, we are assessing capabilities all around us every</p><p>day. We assess everything about our organizations; our bosses, our colleagues and peers, and our employees. We assess our competitors. But if I asked you to turn that lens closer to home, could you do it? What are your capabilities? What about your family’s? It may seem funny to think of ourselves as a composite of resources, processes, and priorities, just like a business. But it’s an insightful way to assess what we are able to accomplish in our own lives—and what might be out of our reach. I’ll bet if you listed your own capabilities, there are some that you know are real strengths and assets. But every one of us has a few areas that we wish were stronger—capabilities you would go back in time and develop better if you could.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of us has the luxury of doing so. Just as Dell can’t wind back the clock on the decisions it made to outsource its capabilities, we can’t go back to our youth to figure out ways to develop the capabilities we wish we had. But, as parents, we do have the opportunity to help our children get it right. The <em>Resources, Processes, and Priorities </em>model of capabilities can help us gauge what our children will need to be able to do, given the types of challenges and problems that we know they will confront in their future.</p><p>The first of the factors that determine what a child can and cannot do is his resources. These include the financial and material resources he has been given or has earned, his time and energy, what he knows, what his talents are, what relationships he has built, and what he has learned from the past.</p><p>The second group of factors that determine a child’s capabilities are processes. Processes are what your child does with the resources he has, to accomplish and create new things for himself. Just as within a business, they are relatively intangible, but are a large part of what makes each child unique. These include the way he thinks, how he asks insightful questions, how and whether he can solve problems of various types, how he works with others, and so on.</p><p>Let me give you some examples to highlight the difference between the resources and processes of a child. Take a young man sitting in class. Teachers and scholars can create knowledge, and our young man can sit in class and passively absorb the knowledge that others have created. That knowledge now becomes a resource for him; he might use it to get a better score on a test that simply measures how much information he has acquired. But it doesn’t necessarily mean he has acquired the ability to <em>create </em>new knowledge. If he were able to take the information he absorbed in class and use it to, say, create an application for a tablet computer, like an iPad, or conduct his own scientific experiment—<em>that </em>capability is a process.</p><p>If those describe the resources and processes of a child, the final capability is the child’s personal priorities. They’re not that dissimilar from the priorities we</p><p>have in our own lives: school, sports, family, work, and faith are all examples. Priorities determine how a child will make decisions in his life—which things in his mind and life he will put to the top of the list, which he will procrastinate doing, and which he will have no interest in doing at all.</p><p>To understand how all three work together, let’s continue the example of a child developing an iPad app. If your child has a computer on which to program, and knowledge of how to program an iPad app, he has resources. The way in which he pulls these resources together to create something novel, something that he hasn’t been taught explicitly how to do, to learn as he goes along—these are his processes. And the desire he has to spend his precious free time creating the app, the problem he cares about enough to create the app to solve, the idea of creating something unique, or the fact that he cares that his friends will be impressed—those are the priorities leading him to do it. Resources are <em>what </em>he uses to do it, processes are <em>how </em>he does it, and priorities are <em>why </em>he does it.</p><p><strong>The Greek Tragedy—Inside Our Families</strong></p><p>I worry <em>a lot </em>that many, many parents are doing to their children what Dell did to its personal-computing business—removing the circumstances in which they can develop processes. As a general rule, in prosperous societies we have been outsourcing more and more of the work that, a generation ago, was done “internally” in the home. It sounds almost quaint by comparison to life now, but in the modest neighborhood in which I grew up, there was a lot of work going on in our homes. We had gardens and fruit trees; we grew a lot of what we ate. We had to preserve much of what we grew so we could eat it during the winter and spring. Our mothers made much of the clothing that we wore; and in the absence of wrinkle-free fabrics, we had to spend hours and hours washing and ironing our clothes. The idea that one might hire someone else to mow the lawn and shovel the snow at your home—it just never happened. There was so much work going on that children essentially worked for their parents.</p><p>Step by step, over the past fifty years, it has become cheaper and easier to outsource this work to professionals. Now the only work being done in many of our homes is a periodic cleanup of the mess that we make. In the absence of work, we’ve created a generation of parents who selflessly devote themselves to providing their children with enriching experiences—so-called soccer moms, a term that wasn’t even part of the American lexicon until fifteen years ago. They lovingly cart children around to soccer, lacrosse, basketball, football, hockey, and baseball teams; dance, gymnastics, music, and Chinese lessons; send them</p><p>on a semester abroad to London; and to so many camps that many children don’t even have the time to get a part-time job in the summer. Taken individually, each of these can be a wonderful chance for a child to develop, and an excellent substitute for all the work that used to take place around the home. Kids can learn to overcome difficult challenges, take on responsibility, become good team players. They’re opportunities to develop the critical processes that kids will need to succeed later in life.</p><p>Too often, however, parents foist all these experiences on their children without that in mind. Now, on one hand, exposing them to lots of activities is commendable. You want to help your kids discover something that they truly enjoy doing, and it’s actually critical for them to find something that will motivate them to develop their own processes.</p><p>But that’s not always the impetus of parents imposing these activities on their children’s lives. Parents have their own job to be done, and it can overshadow the desire to help their children develop processes. They have a job of wanting to feel like a good parent: see all the opportunities I’m providing for my child? Or parents, often with their heart in the right place, project their own hopes and dreams onto their children.</p><p>When these other intentions start creeping in, and parents seem to be carting their children around to an endless array of activities in which the kids are not truly engaged, it should start to raise red flags. Are the children developing from these experiences the deep, important processes such as teamwork, entrepreneurship, and learning the value of preparation? Or are they just going along for the ride? When we so heavily focus on providing our children with resources, we need to ask ourselves a new set of questions: Has my child developed the skill to develop better skills? The knowledge to develop deeper knowledge? The experience to learn from his experiences? These are the critical differences between resources and processes in our children’s minds and hearts —and, I fear, the unanticipated residual of outsourcing.</p><p>When Dell outsourced a part of its business to Asus, Dell gave Asus targets it needed to hit, and problems that it needed to solve. Asus then developed the processes for doing the work—even as Dell’s processes for doing the same work atrophied. Asus honed and expanded those processes so that it could complete more and more sophisticated work. Dell didn’t see that as it was focusing so heavily on resources and reducing its crucial processes, that it was actually undermining its future competitiveness.</p><p>Many parents are making the same mistake, flooding their children with resources—knowledge, skills, and experiences. And just as with Dell, each of the decisions to do so seems to make sense. We want our kids to get ahead, and</p><p>believe that the opportunities and experiences we have provided for them will help them do exactly that. But the nature of these activities—experiences in which they’re not deeply engaged and that don’t really challenge them to do hard things—denies our children the opportunity to develop the processes they’ll need to succeed in the future.</p><p><strong>What My Parents Didn’t Do for Me</strong></p><p>The end result of these good intentions for our children is that too few reach adulthood having been given the opportunity to shoulder onerous responsibility and solve complicated problems for themselves and for others. Self-esteem—the sense that “I’m not afraid to confront this problem and I think I can solve it”— doesn’t come from abundant resources. Rather, self-esteem comes from achieving something important when it’s hard to do.</p><p>At the time of this writing and for the first time in modern economics, unemployment among young men is higher than almost any other group in America and, indeed, this is true of many developed countries around the world. How could this be? Reasonable people can debate whether this is the result of the economic policies of past decades, but I think another factor is contributing to this situation. I worry that an entire generation has reached adulthood without the capabilities—particularly the processes—that translate into employment. We have outsourced the work from our homes, and we’ve allowed the vacuum to be filled with activities that don’t challenge or engage our kids. By sheltering children from the problems that arise in life, we have inadvertently denied this generation the ability to develop the processes and priorities it needs to succeed.</p><p>I’m not advocating throwing kids straight into the deep end to see whether they can swim. Instead, it’s a case of starting early to find simple problems for them to solve on their own, problems that can help them build their processes— and a healthy self-esteem. As I look back on my own life, I recognize that some of the greatest gifts I received from my parents stemmed not from what they did for me—but rather from what they <em>didn’t </em>do for me. One such example: my mother never mended my clothes. I remember going to her when I was in the early grades of elementary school, with holes in both socks of my favorite pair. My mom had just had her sixth child and was deeply involved in our church activities. She was very, very busy. Our family had no extra money anywhere, so buying new socks was just out of the question. So she told me to go string thread through a needle, and to come back when I had done it. That accomplished—it took me about ten minutes, whereas I’m sure she could have done it in ten</p><p>seconds—she took one of the socks and showed me how to run the needle in and out around the periphery of the hole, rather than back and forth across the hole, and then simply to draw the hole closed. This took her about thirty seconds. Finally, she showed me how to cut and knot the thread. She then handed me the second sock, and went on her way.</p><p>A year or so later—I probably was in third grade—I fell down on the playground at school and ripped my Levi’s. This was serious, because I had the standard family ration of two pairs of school trousers. So I took them to my mom and asked if she could repair them. She showed me how to set up and operate her sewing machine, including switching it to a zigzag stitch; gave me an idea or two about how she might try to repair it if it were she who was going to do the repair, and then went on her way. I sat there clueless at first, but eventually figured it out.</p><p>Although in retrospect these were very simple things, they represent a defining point in my life. They helped me to learn that I should solve my own problems whenever possible; they gave me the confidence that I could solve my own problems; and they helped me experience pride in that achievement. It’s funny, but every time I put those socks on until they were threadbare, I looked at that repair in the toe and thought, “I did that.” I have no memory now of what the repair to the knee of those Levi’s looked like, but I’m sure it wasn’t pretty. When I looked at it, however, it didn’t occur to me that I might not have done a perfect mending job. I only felt pride that I had done it.</p><p>As for my mom, I have wondered what she felt when she saw me walk out the door to school wearing those patched-knee trousers. Some mothers might have been embarrassed to have their child seen in such tatters—that it evidenced how few pennies our family had to spare. But I think my mom didn’t even look at my Levi’s. I think she was looking at me, and probably saw in me the same thing I saw in the patch:</p><p>“I did that.”</p><p><strong>Children Learn When They Are Ready to Learn</strong></p><p>Denying children the opportunity to develop their processes is not the only way outsourcing has damaged their capabilities, either. There is something far more important at risk when we outsource too much of our lives: our values.</p><p>Not long ago, I was complimenting a friend on how his children had turned into such terrific adults. He and his wife (I’ll call them Jim and Norma) had raised a wonderful family. Each of their five children turned out to be <em>very</em></p><p>different from one another. But all of them were successful in their careers, had chosen wonderful spouses, and were now raising children of their own, each in different parts of the country.</p><p>I asked Jim and Norma about how they had raised such great children. Of all the gems of wisdom that they shared with me, this insight, from Norma, stood out: “When the kids come home for a family reunion, I like to listen to their banter back and forth about the experiences they had growing up, and which had the greatest impact on their lives. I typically have no memory of the events they recall as being important. And when I ask them about the times when Jim and I sat them down specifically to share what we thought were foundationally important values of our family, well, the kids have no memory of any of them. I guess the thing to learn from this is that children will learn when they are ready to learn, not when we’re ready to teach them.”</p><p>It’s a beautiful way of articulating the importance of building the third of the capabilities—priorities. It affects what our children will put first in their lives. In fact, it may be the single most important capability we can give our kids.</p><p>You can probably recall similar moments from your own childhood—the times that you picked up something important from your parents that they probably weren’t aware they were sharing. Your parents most likely weren’t thinking consciously about teaching you the right priorities at the time—but simply because they were there with you in those learning moments, those values became your values, too. Which means that first, when children are ready to learn, we need to be there. And second, we need to be found displaying through our actions, the priorities and values that we want our children to learn.</p><p>Yet again, in outsourcing much of the work that formerly filled our homes, we have created a void in our children’s lives that often gets filled with activities in which we are not involved. And as a result, when our children are ready to learn, it is often people whom we do not know or respect who are going to be there.</p><p>There’s a wonderful conundrum left to us by the Greeks. It was first put to print by the author Plutarch, and it’s known as the Ship of Theseus. As a tribute to the mythical founder of their city—famed for slaying the Minotaur—the Athenians committed to keeping Theseus’s ship seaworthy in the harbor of Athens. As parts of the boat decayed, they were replaced ... until eventually, every last part of the boat had been changed.</p><p>The conundrum was this: given that every last part of it had been replaced, was it still Theseus’s ship? The Athenians still called it Theseus’s Ship ... but was it?</p><p>I want to turn that into a similar philosophical question for you: if your</p><p>children gain their priorities and values from other people ... whose children are they?</p><p>Yes, they are still your children—but you see what I’m getting at. The risk is not that every moment spent with another adult will be indelibly transferring inferior values. Nor is this about making the argument that you need to protect your children from the “big bad world”—that you must spend every waking moment with them. You shouldn’t. Balance is important, and there are valuable lessons your children will gain from facing the challenges that life will throw at them on their own.</p><p>Rather, the point is that even if you’re doing it with the best of intentions, if you find yourself heading down a path of outsourcing more and more of your role as a parent, you will lose more and more of the precious opportunities to help your kids develop their values—which may be the most important capability of all.</p><p><em>You have your children’s best interests at heart when you provide them with resources. It’s what most parents think they’re supposed to do—provide for their child. You can compare with your neighbors and friends how many activities your child is involved in, what instruments he is learning, what sports she is playing. It’s easy to measure and it makes you feel good. But too much of this loving gesture can actually undermine their becoming the adults you want them to be.</em></p><p><em>Children need to do more than learn new skills. The theory of </em>capabilities <em>suggests they need to be challenged. They need to solve hard problems. They need to develop values. When you find yourself providing more and more experiences that are not giving children an opportunity to be deeply engaged, you are not equipping them with the processes they need to succeed in the future. And if you find yourself handing your children over to other people to give them all these experiences</em>—outsourcing—<em>you are, in fact, losing valuable opportunities to help nurture and develop them into the kind of adults you respect and admire. Children will learn when they’re ready to learn, not when you’re ready to teach them; if you are not with them as they encounter challenges in their lives, then you are missing important opportunities to shape their priorities—and their lives.</em></p><p>“</p>
