You have heroically slayed the dragons and unlocked the creativity and genius buried deep inside.</p><p>But how do you actually get there?</p><p>You can analyze the myths of visionary creators–artists, writers, musicians, software developers, etc that have accomplished the impossible.  You’ll read about how they <em>went for it</em>, <em>refused to quit</em>, and <em>would not be denied</em>. But exactly how these successful creators went from being fearful dreamers to accomplished artists proves elusive. They seem to have secret sauce inside that you just don’t possess.</p><p><em>Running Down a Dream </em>unflinchingly bares the naked truth behind all creations and shares the practical to-do list to take you from here to there.</p><p>The good news?  You don’t have to be an Austen or a Michelangelo or an Oprah to create a work of art.</p><p>The bad news? There is no glossing over the pain, embarrassment, and financial terror necessary to contend with on your journey to mission accomplished.</p><p>More good news? What lies ahead for you is the realization of your heroic self. The run is worth it in ways you can’t yet imagine.<br/>”<br/></p><p>2)  Shawn Coyne:</p><p>&quot;<br/>The digital age requires just as much courage and forbearance as the analog age did. The heat of the fight has just moved from an external one to an internal one. No matter the battle, doing truthful and authentic work is exhausting.</p><p>Just like the old Steelworker lunch pails offered relief from the life threatening work in the mill, we need to pack our own symbolic lunch before we forge our work. If we do, it will get us through those days when we don't think we have another drop of sweat to give. In this spirit, we offer Turning Pro and:</p><p>The Lunch Pail Manifesto</p><p>We must find the work that brings our lives meaning.</p><p>We must strive to make our work purposeful, truthful, and authentic, a pure offering to our Muse and fellow human beings.</p><p>We must wage a lifelong war with Resistance and accept that instant gratification is an oxymoron.</p><p>We must not speak of our work with false modesty or braggadocio.</p><p>We must not debase our work for short term gain nor elevate it above its rightful station to inflate our ego.</p><p>We must not covet the fruits of our work, or the fruits of others’ work.</p><p>We must respect others’ work and offer aid to fellow professional laborers.</p><p>We must accept that our work will never be perfect.</p><p>We must accept that our work will never be without merit.</p><p>We must accept that our work will never cease.<br/>&quot;</p><p />
