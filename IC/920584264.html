                    <p>“Leaders are not, as we are often led to think, people who go along with huge crowds following them. Leaders are people who go their own way without caring, or even looking to see, whether anyone is following them. &quot;Leadership qualities&quot; are not the qualities that enable people to attract followers, but those that enable them to do without them. They include, at the very least, courage, endurance, patience, humor, flexibility, resourcefulness, stubbornness, a keen sense of reality, and the ability to keep a cool and clear head, even when things are going badly. True leaders, in short, do not make people into followers, but into other leaders.” <br/>― <a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1792210.John_Holt" rel="nofollow">John Holt</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/560019" rel="nofollow">Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book Of Homeschooling</a></p><p /><p>“We learn to do something by doing it.<br/>There is no other way.” <br/>― <a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1792210.John_Holt" rel="nofollow">John Holt</a></p><p><br/>Many other great quotes from John Holt here - and references to his books:<a class="external-link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1792210.John_Holt" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1792210.John_Holt</a></p><p><br/>info on top left and bottom of this page - many resources for learning - <strong>the focus in kids and schooling, our challenge is to apply this to adults and work</strong>:  <a class="external-link" href="https://www.johnholtgws.com/pat-farengas-blog/2017/5/18/the-alliance-for-self-directed-education-website-is-officially-launched" rel="nofollow">https://www.johnholtgws.com/pat-farengas-blog/2017/5/18/the-alliance-for-self-directed-education-website-is-officially-launched</a></p><p /><p />
