If I work with them, then my peeps will want to work</p><p /><p>.<br/>2</p><p>CONTEXT of the personal convo <br/>Separate into give &amp; ask <br/>first - diagnostic helping call - 100% on them - purely help them - as an audition to bey next client </p><p /><p>in the GIVE:</p><p>1 ASK: Tell me where you have been about X (this opens them up to talk about 5 - 7 min, if they do this, will more likely sell) <br/>2 ASK - can I treat you like a client - rest of the time, we can go into how I can help them (say is it ok to treat you for the rest as a fee paid  - what need to hear not want to hear - if that is ok with you? Get permission to be investigative clear and hold up a mirror) <br/>(when treat prospects like clients, get more clients) <br/>3 ASK one more question - 2 kinds - all want free info and info - some happy to go, others are also in test-drive mode and want to maybe work together (30% have a problem, priority, opportunity to maximize/ 50% love me - I will be in charge/ 20% no intention of hiring, but you helped me and I would love to talk about working together )</p><p /><p>If positive <br/>I appreciate you may want to work together <br/>I meant to deliver value  - now if want to move forward <br/>ASK - lets book another time today or tomorrow)<br/>this sets up the sales call at the end of the helping call  - because they have ASKED for a sales call, so strike while iron is hot - do it NOW - everyone knows it is a sales convo <br/>hopefully they are taking notes and visioning it working for them before get into a sales call </p><p>then in the sales call<br/>ASK for the sale after taking about what is possible for them </p><p>.<br/>3<br/>Initial Outreach <br/>do industry and prospect research <br/>from here we can answer their WHYs </p><p>we are all sellers and buyers always <br/>Must Tell the Potential BUYER (in their world, relative to them - not my offer - their x y z)<br/>why THIS - why relevant - what is common ground?<br/>why ME - what does this have to do with me - how I serve their needs <br/>why NOW - what about this moment that sparked this thing - is this worth a short chat?</p><p>(if can cut and paste - it is SPAM - no it is focused on THEM)<br/>this works for small number of prospects - not a million </p><p>.<br/>the Temptation is to talk about MY stuff and how it all works <br/>NO - focus on their Needs <br/>Mule vs Magician <br/>Mule - the heavier the box the better - all about the details <br/>Magic - what they really want - they want the RESULT as quick as Possible - NOW  - the faster and easier the better - how can I get them to be IN without all the details <br/>ie sell Value - <strong>sell destination, not transportation </strong>- done’t sell the 747, sell the beautiful romantic vacation </p><p /><p /><p />
