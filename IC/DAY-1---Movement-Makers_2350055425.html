more important to be faithful to assignment then to chase numbers <br/><br/>Jesus - his movement was 12 - don’t get tricked by numbers <br/>((PIC))<br/><br/>Charismatic Leader (Attractive Leader)<br/>Cause - MUST take a STAND (your Culture) - about FUTURE - need to have a Big &amp; Clear Future ahead that are Pursuing - stand translates to future-based CAUSE<br/>New Opportunity (Your Vehicle of Change) -

worst things happen and how that affects me for the thing I am doing today.<br/><br/>2) CARING - about them at a level that no one else has done before - caring the most. this alone is not enough - but also need to be COMPETENT  - opening heart to love care service - <br/>prayer - to be led by service, by love - asking for help to understand the people I mean to help - what are their fears and desires<br/>If god can trust you with his people, he will tell you secrets about them, so can have divine insights  - can say to them in the marketplace what they have never spoken.<br/><br/>3) COMPETENT <br/><br/><br/>.<br/>where can I take a STAND for something/someone - customers I have or want - in area of Passion of mine <br/>what pain problem -
