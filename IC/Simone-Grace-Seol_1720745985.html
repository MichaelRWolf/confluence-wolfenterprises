                    <p>Simone is a business coach who runs <a class="external-link" href="https://www.simonegraceseol.com" rel="nofollow">Joyful Marketing.</a> </p><p /><p>Her copy is fun, refreshing, and in line with the kinds of ways we look at work and coaching. I feel like she strike a good balance between working without over-structuring (or rather, seeing structure as the reason we don’t go forward) and honoring ourselves in all the messiness that shows up in real life.</p><p /><p>She has a coaching program, as well as a podcast.</p><p /><p>Here’s the email sequences that I’ve seen from her so far:</p><p /><p>Weird Rule #1: Feeling like shit is not a problem.<em><strong>Weird Rule #1: Feeling like shit is GOOD.</strong></em></p><p>Conventional coach marketing says: Be aligned! Be in sufficiency! Dance on a sea of unicorn farts, and inspire people to want the same! </p><p>I say: Feeling like absolute fucking garbage a lot of the time... IS your superpower.</p><p>So much of what fucks us up when we try to get a business up and running... is <em>how often we just feel really fucking terrible. </em></p><p>All of the self-doubt. The fear. The shame. The imposter syndrome, the exhaustion, the recurrent trauma responses.</p><p>&quot;If I'm swimming in a sea of yuck, how the hell am I qualified to offer people help with <em>their</em> lives?&quot;</p><p>Be honest. How often has that brought you down?</p><p>Well, guess what? You might have been programmed by what I call “Feel Good Fascism.”</p><p><strong>Feel Good Fascism says, feeling good is morally superior to feeling bad.</strong></p><p><strong>Feel Good Fascism says, feeling bad is &quot;less than,&quot; and it makes you weak, faulty, defective somehow.</strong></p><p>&quot;I mean, look... If you drank more green juice, self-coached correctly, did more exercise and managed your time better, you'd probably feel better, so you've got nobody else to blame for feeling bad.</p><p>You just have to stop being a lazy, negative, trash-eating asshole, okay?&quot;</p><p><strong>Feel Good Fascism is the most insidiously hidden form of ableism.</strong></p><p>Got trauma - personal, familial or ancestral?</p><p>Did horrible things happen to you or your people?</p><p>Got an ADHD, autistic, depression-prone, anxiety-prone, or highly-sensitive brain?</p><p>“Please go away with all of your messy, inconvenient, impolite wounding. We only talk about the weather, #slayingit, Instagram analytics over here.”</p><p>That’s the messaging we’ve been subject to all our lives. </p><p><strong>Feel Good Fascism is Orwellian.</strong></p><p>It says, our ultimate aim in life is to exist in a serotonin-oxytocin-dopamine-spiked state... because it doesn't threaten the status quo. </p><p>Any other state serves no purpose except to distract us from the simplicity of living a shallow, unquestioning, alchemy-free, lap-dog-like existence.</p><p>When there's no serotonin-oxytocin-dopamine, your condition is something to be overcome and changed as fast as possible.</p><p>(The way we life coaches are complicit in this... is, sometimes consciously and other times unconsciously, we've normalized pain-avoidance in the name of &quot;healing&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;evolution.&quot;)</p><p>Feel Good Fascism turns feeling good into a credential.</p><p><em>&quot;See? I feel so good. This is who I am. Here's an Instagram picture of me to prove it -- looking blissed out in a pool in a 5-star resort on a tropical island that was formerly colonized land, and now where 1% of the white people own 99% of the capital! Look at my shiny life and smile in my hot bikini! I am totally qualified to lead you to live #yourbestlife!&quot;</em></p><p><em>&quot;And you over there, sitting in your stained pajamas, typing on your old ass laptop that keeps crashing, in your apartment in that dodgy zip code! Please, just stop it now. You're making the rest of us life coaches look bad.&quot;</em></p><p><strong>Feel Good Fascism is the opposite of love.</strong></p><p>It's fear.</p><p>Fear of our own complexity... and fear of paradox... which is really fear of the true, vast, profound, immeasurable greatness of the human spirit.</p><p>It flinches away from darkness because it thinks it cannot survive touching it.</p><p>But it is wrong.</p><p>We can survive it. In fact, we are made to survive it.</p><p>Not only are we meant to survive it, we are meant to be FORMED and FORGED FROM IT. It is meant to show us who we truly are. And we do not have to be afraid of it.</p><p>We are life coaches. And we will not be complicit in upholding a political, economic or spiritual order based on fear. We can and will do, so, so, so much better.</p><p><strong>Feeling good is not a precondition for your authority as a life coach. </strong></p><p>If you’re feeling shitty, it means you’re living the shit out of life, paying attention, and growing. </p><p>Feeling like shit IS your credential.</p><p>Coach from it, lead from it, and market from it.</p><p>xo,</p><p>Simone</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="c1667911-8996-4406-a920-1323437f3fc9" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 680.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>P.S.

They look pretty, but in the end, usually just make me feel like a failure.</p><p>I never plan my launches. I mean, my plan amounts to (1) decide what I'm offering, and (2) tell people about it. But that's about it.</p><p>I don't have one of those neat lists, detailing what is &quot;due&quot; when. I just have a feeling I should start to work on something. And I do. for the most part. If I don't meet a &quot;deadline&quot;, too bad. </p><p>I don't write my emails in advance. And I often send them at 3:29 AM, as inspiration strikes.</p><p><strong>I have ADHD.</strong></p><p>My brain doesn't work in a way where lists and plans and schedules make sense. In fact, my brain staunchly rebels against them.</p><p>And I still have a world-changing business that makes piles of money. </p><p>It's possible to have a different brain - one that does NOT thrive with organization and planning-in-advance and lists - and STILL create everything you want.</p><p>​Maybe your thing isn't ADHD.

Love is the best magnetic force. Love draws your soulmate clients in, and Love fills in all the gaps. </p><p><strong>BEING LOVING is the best marketing strategy.</strong></p><p>Now I have millions of dollars in revenue to prove it... but I didn't always know what this meant. </p><p>You see, I have a very fiery, fierce nature. It got me in a lot of trouble.</p><p><strong>Fiery and fierce WITHOUT love = snarky, self-righteous, and dictatorial</strong></p><p>It was not how I wanted to be in the world. So I figured out a different way to be.</p><p>I decided to try something different. I decided to add love to the mix.</p><p><strong>Fiery and fierce WITH love = sharp, innovative, galvanizing</strong></p><p>Now, THAT was a recipe that worked.</p><p>Here's how to find the recipe that works for YOU.</p><p>I also talk a lot about the importance of BEING YOUR UNIQUE SELF. The thing that makes you stand out in a crowd.</p><p>After all, nobody has your precise combination of history and personality. You are one of a kind, one-in-seven-billion.</p><p>BUT being unique IN AND OF ITSELF doesn't do any good if you're not loving on some part of yourself.</p><p>Notice how, the way most people react to themselves (their history, personality, interests, strengths and weaknesses)... is only with SELECTIVE love?</p><p>All the shiny, normal, socially acceptable stuff gets plenty of sunshine and airtime... and the rest get shoved under a moldy rug in the basement? and <em>la la la let's pretend it doesn't exist?</em></p><p>Baby, you gotta add love to ALL of it... because, here's the winning formula:</p><p><strong>UNIQUENESS + LOVE = POWER</strong></p><ul><li><p>When you pour love on the thing-you've-been-trying-to-hide (like your 3 a.m. panic attacks, your imperfect marriage, or your childhood trauma from leaving a dogmatic religion), your presence becomes medicinal for others. Because it gives them permission to show up and take up space, too.</p></li><li><p>When you pour love on your REAL stories -- especially the one that are hard for you to tell -- and TELL them, you become inspiring AF. Because most people are hiding from their own.</p></li><li><p>When you pour love on your &quot;flaws&quot;, your less-socially-acceptable 'edges,' they become your competitive advantage. (example: My ADHD makes me a fast-acting powerhouse. My laziness makes me a master of efficient shortcuts.)</p></li><li><p>When you bring love wherever you go, and ASSUME love in every single social interaction, you become a force of nature. People cannot help but gravitate towards you, because EVERYONE wants to be around that.</p></li></ul><p>​</p><p>No amount of algorithm-hacking, fancy photo-shoot-ing, or copy-tweaking is as important as LOVE.</p><p>For your self.</p><p>And for others.</p><p>Giving it before you get it.</p><p>Pouring it on the light AND the darkness.</p><p>On the order AND the chaos.</p><p>The best thing about love is that it's available to all of us... in infinite quantities... free of charge.</p><p>The more we access, the more there is that can flow through us.</p><p>And the more we access, the more we become the kind of person clients have to follow, stalk, and eventually pay to work with.</p><p>xo,</p><p>Simone</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="1ab0d261-795b-4fcd-81f0-af100e41408b" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 680.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>P.S.

My only aim is to LOVE on you through them. Yes, I also sell through them. But selling is one of the ways I express love.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I should elaborate on that, right? Selling is one of the ways I express love. </p></li></ul><p>I learned in seminary (yes, I was once in seminary) that love is a not a concept or a feeling, but an action, a verb. When I sell people on something, my aim is to get them MOVING. Toward wholeness. Toward love. Whatever concrete action that might look like on a given day.</p><p>At some level, I'll always be a seminarian, and movement toward love is the only thing I will ever sell. <br/>​</p><ul><li><p>I don’t ever worry about my “ideal customer avatar” but I DO write for a very specific kind of people (and you must, too). </p></li></ul><p>The kind of people who appreciate me exactly as I am, with all my straight-talkin' bossiness, woo, imperfection and earnestness. I don’t try to contort myself into winning over any other kind of person because I'm bad at pretending to be someone I'm not. </p><ul><li><p>Everyone I am in the position to help is my client, regardless of whether they pay me. That means I'm here to make use of what I have to be useful to whoever comes my way. That way, I am always in business, never wasting time feeling confused about what to do next.</p></li></ul><p>You get to make up your own business rules.</p><p>What are yours? </p><p>Xo,</p><p>Simone</p><p><strong>P.S. — if you’re not sure, I invite you to </strong><a class="external-link" href="https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmuz9n0mg6bmh9q220a6/48hvheh0nlkd3gix/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2ltb25lZ3JhY2VzZW9sLmNvbS9qb3lmdWxtYXJrZXRpbmc=" rel="nofollow"><strong>join Joyful Marketing</strong></a><strong> today and find out. </strong></p><p><strong>Here’s what our community member Maggie Reyes says about what it’s like:</strong></p><p><em><strong>“Joyful Marketing is the perfect combination of learning how to cultivate and harness the wisdom of your heart, fuel it with the power of your brain, and share your message with the world. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Instead of creating more silos and separations between how you offer your services and how you deliver them, you learn how to integrate all parts of yourself into the words you use to talk to your community about your work. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Joyful Marketing is where will you learn to think about your future clients as hearts to heal instead of leads to capture.
